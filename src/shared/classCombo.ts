// CLASS-COMBO INFERENCE — the shared data model (docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md § 3).
//
// EQ Legends runs UP TO THREE CLASSES AT ONCE and the log NEVER states a loadout swap. The
// character's own `/who` row is the only line that ever names the combo outright, and there
// are ELEVEN of them in 1.1M lines. Everything else in this model is INFERENCE, and world-model
// law 1 ("messages over inference; anything inferred is LABELED inferred") is why every type
// here carries provenance, a confidence, and an explicit representation of NOT KNOWING:
//   * a slot with several candidates is AMBIGUOUS — it says {CLR,PAL}, it does not pick PAL;
//   * a slot with no evidence at all is UNKNOWN — all 16 candidates, confidence 0;
//   * an interval boundary is a RANGE [startLo, startHi], never an instant, because a swap
//     prints nothing and the two events that bracket it can be 33.9 hours apart.
//
// Lives in shared/ (the shared/types.ts precedent) so preload and the renderer can import the
// types without crossing the main↔web tsconfig boundary; the pure read model that joins other
// records to these intervals is shared/comboIndex.ts.
