// TRIAGE CONTRACT — the shapes the DEV-ONLY triage tab moves across IPC.
// ============================================================================
//
// This file is the seam between `src/main/triage/**` (which talks to Aurora DSQL and S3 over
// the launching shell's AWS profile) and `src/renderer/src/features/triage/**` (which renders
// what it is handed and fetches nothing itself — the renderer never reaches the network, and
// the CSP is untouched by this feature).
//
// WHY THE SHAPES LIVE HERE AND NOT IN `src/main/triage`: the renderer names every one of them
// and cannot import from `src/main` under either tsconfig. Same reasoning, same placement as
// `src/shared/feedback.ts`'s IPC-crossing block.
//
// PURE, like every other `src/shared/**` module: zero imports beyond the feedback contract's
// own type unions, no `node:`, no Electron, no DOM.
//
// THE LAW (docs/plans/feedback-triage.md §10.3) applies to everything here: a raw log slice
// never reaches anything public. `TriageSlice.lines` travels main -> renderer over IPC and is
// rendered in a local window; it is never written to a file the app publishes, never put in an
// issue body, and only ever exists in a build that has the dev flag compiled in.

// approximated silently:
//
//   * per-feature REACH % (share of installs that used a feature) would need per-id,
//     per-feature state — the per-user trail T6 refuses to keep. `uses` and `perSession` are
//     what the counters can say, and the panel labels them as such.
//   * MEDIAN session length is a BUCKET RANGE (`medianSessionLabel`), because a median cannot
//     be summed across days; the ingest path keeps a histogram precisely so this is answerable
//     at all, and it is answerable to a bucket, not to a millisecond.
//   * RETENTION is survival: "first seen on day D and still seen on or after D+N", read off
//     `analytics_install`. It is not "came back ON day D+N" — no per-day-per-id row exists.
//
// `available: false` means exactly ONE class of thing: this cluster does not have what this
// code reads — a table the A2 migration creates, or the `cohort` column the user/owner split
// added. Tables that exist and are EMPTY render as honest zeros with a "no data yet" note — an
// empty stack is a real, informative state and hiding it behind the same arm as "not deployed"
// would make the two indistinguishable.

// `owner` is a SECOND, COMPLETE readout rendered beside it when asked for. Two values rather
// than a cohort field on every row, because that shape makes summing them require writing code
// that adds two `TriageAnalyticsData`s together, which nobody will ever accidentally do.

// ---- release health (JOS-96) ------------------------------------------------------------
//
// "DID I RELEASE BUGGY CODE" — an error rate per build, over time, read against how many people
// were actually ON that build and when it went out. Four sources, and they are deliberately
// different KINDS of evidence rather than four columns of the same thing:
//
//   * ERRORS come from `health` / `healthReports`, both dimmed by version (telemetryRollup.ts).
//     The rate is self-normalizing at one version, so a popular build cannot look buggier than
//     an unpopular one purely by having more sessions.
//   * ADOPTION comes from the `version` envelope fact, which EVERY client has always sent —
//     which is why the adoption curve is complete back through history while the error curve
//     starts the day a capable client shipped.
//   * RELEASE DATES come from `RELEASE_NOTES` (shared/releaseNotes.ts): committed source,
//     reviewed in the diff that ships it, available offline. Not a GitHub fetch.
//   * BUG REPORTS come from the feedback `report` table's `app_version` — a bug-rate proxy that
//     covers EVERY version ever shipped, including the ones that predate health reporting. It is
//     the only honest signal about those builds, and it is a different measurement (a human
//     bothered to type something) that must never be added to the error counts.
//
// THE HOUSE RULE, and it is the reason half these fields exist: A QUIET VERSION IS NOT A CLEAN
// ONE. A build that predates the emitting client sends no health report at all, so its error
// count is absent — identical, to a SUM, to a build that reported perfectly and found nothing.

// `null` rather than 0 when nothing reported, and `coverage` says what share of the fleet is on
// builds that can report at all, so the reader can see how much of the picture is missing.
