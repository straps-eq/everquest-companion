// `planScalarChanges` for the settings that cannot be merged additively at all.
//
// Split out of src/shared/profiles.ts (which had grown past the 400-code-line factoring
// ceiling) with the rules unchanged. `shared/profiles` re-exports every name here, so it is
// still the one import site for consumers and no import path changed.

 *                                     would just double the sound. Makes import idempotent.
 *   same id, different behavior     → REKEY to `<id>~<behaviorKey4>` and keep BOTH. Ids
 *                                     like 'charm-break' are seeded identically for every
 *                                     user, so an id collision means "different objects,
 *                                     colliding namespace", never "same object". The suffix
 *                                     is derived from the behavior (not a random or a
 *                                     counter) so importing the SAME string twice lands on
 *                                     the same id and the second pass skips.
 *   otherwise                       → ADD under its own id, preserving it across the hop so
 *                                     round-tripping a set is stable.
 *
 * Name clashes never affect identity; a colliding name just gets " (imported)" appended so
 * the list stays readable.
 *
 * MISSING SOUND PACK: if the sound's packId isn't installed, the alert is STILL imported —
 * flagged, with the pack name surfaced so the user can install it from the registry
 * browser. We never silently re-point it at a default (that would fabricate the sender's
 * intent) and never silently drop it (that would mute it invisibly).
