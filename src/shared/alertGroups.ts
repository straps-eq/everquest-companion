// alertGroups.ts — the CURATED one-click alert groups ("grounded sane defaults").
//
// A GROUP is a small, coherent set of AlertDefs the user turns on with one click: "Out of
// range", "Resists", "Mez / root broke". It is the counterpart to the per-spell suggestion
// templates in features/alerts/suggestions.ts — those answer "alert me about THIS spell",
// these answer "alert me about the things that silently cost you a pull".
//
// THE LAW HERE IS VERIFICATION. Every trigger below was checked READ-ONLY against the real
// log (eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt, 1,144,036 lines, 2026-08-03) and the exact matched line
// shape + its occurrence count is quoted beside it. A group whose line does NOT exist in the
// log ships `verified: false` and is NOT rendered — a guessed regex that never fires is worse
// than an absent feature, because the user believes they are covered. Two groups the owner
// asked for are in exactly that state (feign-death failure, pet death); their comments say
// why, so nobody re-derives the same dead end.
//
// PARSED EVENTS OVER RAW REGEXES. Where the parser already emits a typed event for the line
// (resist, uncharm, cc, castFizzle, castInterrupted, playerDeath) the trigger uses the EVENT
// kind: it survives log-format drift, it carries structured `where` fields, and the parse is
// already golden-window tested. Raw regexes are used only for lines no event covers — the
// four client-side notices ("too far away", "out of range", "cannot see", "Insufficient
// Mana"), the two invisibility lines and the block notice.
//
// SOUNDS mirror the shipped Alan Rickman pack the same way suggestions.ts does — the ids are
// repeated as literals because a renderer module cannot import from src/main. They are
// declared in src/main/data/defaultPacks.ts (`DEFAULT_ALERT_SOUNDS`) so provisionPacks
// verifies they resolved after an install; keep the two lists in sync.
//
// COOLDOWNS are per-group judgment calls, documented on each group. The rule of thumb: the
// cooldown is the length of ONE user-visible episode, not the gap between two log lines — a
// melee out-of-range notice repeats 2-4× per second for as long as you hold auto-attack, so
// its cooldown is "tell me once per approach", not "once per line".

 * (main/modules/alerts.ts `compileFieldMatch`). That is what lets ONE def cover the whole
 * family, which is the point: a slow is a spell you REPLACE as you level, so a def pinned to
 * one name goes silently dead at the next tier. An enchanter walks Languid Pace (9) → Tepid
 * Deeds (23) → Shiftless Deeds (41) → Forlorn Deeds (57) and a shaman walks Drowsy (5) →
 * Walking Sleep (13) → Tagar's (27) → Togor's (38) → Turgur's (51) → Tigir's (58); one alert
 * has to survive all of it or it is worse than no alert.
 *
 * THE ROSTER IS DB KNOWLEDGE, NOT A GUESS. It is every spells.json entry whose cast-on-other
 * message is one of the game's two slow landing emotes — `Someone slows down.` (the enchanter
 * line, and the one AGENTS.md's log-format reference already names as a slow LANDING) and
 * `Someone yawns.` (the shaman line). Same argument as the rogue-slow group below, which
 * matches on the poison `effect` rather than on a Strike name and reads its coat roster out of
 * shared/poisons.ts: a family the DB enumerates is evidence, and pinning one member is the
 * fragile choice. The two NPC-ONLY members of those emote families (Rejuvenation, Energy Sap)
 * are deliberately absent — you cannot cast them, so `Your <X> spell has worn off of …` can
 * never print for one.
 *
 * The `.` in `Tagar.s` is doing real work: EQ writes possessives with BOTH an apostrophe and a
 * backtick and the spell DB carries both spellings of the same spell (`Turgur's Insects` /
 * `Turgur\`s Insects`), so one character class covers the pair instead of eight alternatives.
 *
 * WHAT THE OWNER'S LOG ACTUALLY PRINTED (read-only sweep of eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt,
 * 1,406,311 lines, 2026-08-06): 52 mob-side wear-offs across three of the ten — Shiftless
 * Deeds 26, Languid Pace 23, Tepid Deeds 3 — and zero for the other seven, because this
