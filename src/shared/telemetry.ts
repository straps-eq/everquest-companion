// ============================================================================
// TELEMETRY CONTRACT — the ONE definition of what usage analytics may ever say.
// ============================================================================
//
// Imported by FOUR consumers and owned by none of them:
//   * the renderer          (`window.eq.track()` builds these values and nothing else),
//   * the main process      (re-validates at the IPC boundary before a single event is
//                            buffered — renderer input is untrusted, same law as every
//                            other handler),
//   * the doc generator     (`src/shared/telemetryDoc.ts` renders TELEMETRY.md from the
//                            tables below, so the published doc cannot drift from the code),
//   * the ingest Lambda     (wave A2 — `validateTelemetryBatch` is the server's whole shape
//                            check, exactly as `validateSubmit` is for feedback).
//
// THE VALIDATORS LIVE NEXT DOOR, in `./telemetryValidate.ts`. That split is a factoring
// decision and nothing more (the contract plus its validators is past the repo's 400-code-line
// ceiling); the two files are one definition and only ever move together.
//
// LAWS THIS FILE OBEYS (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md T2):
//
//   * PURE. Zero imports — no `node:`, no Electron, no DOM, not even `shared/types.ts`.
//     It compiles under both tsconfigs, is read by `storeMigrations.ts` at store.ts's module
//     scope, and has to bundle into a Lambda. (`tests/telemetryContract.test.mts` pins the
//     duplicated overlay-kind list against the real `OVERLAY_KINDS`, so the copy cannot rot.)
//
//   * THE SCHEMA CANNOT EXPRESS A NAME. There is no free-text field anywhere in the event
//     union. Every string-typed field is a member of a CLOSED enum declared in this file;
//     the only two exceptions are `analyticsId` (a v4 UUID, regex-pinned) and `appVersion`
//     (semver, regex-pinned), neither of which can carry prose. A character, zone, mob,
//     spell, item, file path or log line has nowhere to go — not because we remember to
//     strip it, but because the type has no slot for it.
//
//   * WHERE A RAW NUMBER IS ITSELF REVEALING, THE SCHEMA CARRIES A BUCKET, and the bucket
//     EDGES are declared here so TELEMETRY.md prints them exactly. "How many characters do
//     you play" and "how big is your log" are facts about a person; "3–4" and "100–512 MB"
//     are facts about a population.
//
//   * The validators are TOTAL and side-effect free: every failure is a typed value, nothing
//     throws, and the same call on the same input always returns the same answer.

//
// THE ADDITIVE-FIELD RULE (learned while adding `linesParsed`, 2026-08-06). A shipped client can
// be talking to a server running an OLDER copy of this contract, because the app auto-updates
// itself and the Lambda is deployed by hand. The two ways to add a measurement are NOT equally
// safe under that skew:
//
//   * A NEW EVENT KIND is fatal. `validateTelemetryBatch` fails the WHOLE batch on an unknown
//     `t`, the endpoint answers 400, and `telemetryPermanentRefusal` (main/telemetry/net.ts)
//     classes 400 as "these bytes will never be accepted" and DROPS the batch. So a client that
//     emits an event the deployed server has never heard of throws away every counter it is
//     carrying, on every flush, until the deploy lands.
//
//   * A NEW OPTIONAL FIELD on an existing kind is free. The validators do not sanitize an object,
//     they CONSTRUCT one field by field — so an older server simply does not copy the field
//     across, accepts the batch, and counts everything else exactly as before. The measurement
//     starts at zero and begins moving the moment the Lambda is redeployed.
//
// That is why `linesParsed` rides on `sessionHeartbeat`/`sessionEnd` instead of arriving as its
// own event: the client half of this feature is safe to ship BEFORE the additive infra apply.
//
// `startup` (JOS-57) is the SECOND measurement to take that deal, and it took it for exactly the
// same reason. A `startupReplay` event of its own would have read better and would have blacked
// out every counter this app collects — not just the startup ones — on every install that
// auto-updated ahead of the Lambda deploy. What it costs instead is stated on the field itself:
// the reading rides the next session report, so a launch killed before either one is lost.
