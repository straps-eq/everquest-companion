  // ---- GLOBAL FIGHT SELECTION (docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md P4/P5/P6) ----
  // ONE fight is selected app-wide: picking one in the Combat tab's picker or in ANY
  // fight-scoped overlay selector writes it, and every fight-scoped surface follows. Main holds
  // it EPHEMERALLY (src/main/fightSelection.ts — resets to '__live__' at startup, never stored)
  // and is the only process that can reach every window, which is why this is IPC and not a
  // renderer-side broadcast.

  // ZONE SESSIONS ARE NOT HERE, on purpose: an 'overall' / 'heal-overall' selector keeps its own
  // per-overlay selection and neither reads nor writes these channels (the ruling's carve-out).
  // Neither does selection ever change a surface's Fight-vs-Overall SCOPE (P5, the standing law).
  //
  // renderer(any window) -> main: read the current selection, for hydrating a surface that
  // mounted after the last change. Returns the id string.
  fightSelectionGet: 'fightSelection:get',
  // renderer(any window) -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "the user picked this fight". The payload is
  // VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER against the shared model (`normalizeFightSelection`) — a non-string,
  // a zone-session id or anything hand-crafted is dropped rather than fanned out.
  fightSelectionSet: 'fightSelection:set',
  // main -> EVERY window: the selection changed. Payload {fightId}. Sent to the main window and
  // all overlay kinds; a window with no fight-scoped surface simply has no listener.
  onFightSelection: 'fightSelection:changed',

  // ---- cursor ring + overlay auto-hide (presence-driven settings) ----
  // Both blobs are main-owned (electron-store), so Preferences has no other door. The setters
  // are MERGE-PATCHES and every field is re-validated + clamped AT THE HANDLER through
  // `shared/presencePrefs.ts` — the same normalizer the store migration uses, so a renderer and

  onCursorRingConfig: 'cursorRing:config',
  // main -> renderer(ring window ONLY): one cursor sample, in the ring window's own CSS px.
  // THE HOT CHANNEL: ~8 ms cadence, and ONLY while the ring is enabled AND EQ is focused AND
  // the point actually moved. Nothing is sent otherwise — that gating is the performance
  // contract, and it is asserted in tests/presence.test.mts.
  onCursorPoint: 'cursorRing:point',

  // ---- auto-update (Task #27; reworked in Task #55) ----
  // main -> renderer: push update lifecycle {state, version?, percent?, message?, checkedAt?}.
  onUpdateStatus: 'update:status',
  // renderer -> main: PULL the last status. The push above only reaches renderers that
  // were mounted at the transition; Preferences mounts late, so it hydrates from here.
  getUpdateStatus: 'update:getStatus',
  // renderer -> main: run a check now ("Check for updates"). Resolves to the resulting
  // status; a no-op idle status in dev.
  checkForUpdates: 'update:checkNow',
  // renderer -> main: apply the downloaded update now (quit + install + relaunch).
  installUpdate: 'update:install',
  // renderer -> main: the running app's version (app.getVersion()), shown in Preferences.
  getAppVersion: 'app:getVersion',

  // ---- event feed / 'events' overlay (Task #59) ----
  // renderer(main app) -> main: report a renderer-DETECTED feed event (today: a Sky quest
  // completed live — only the renderer's posky/turn-in machinery can see that). Main owns the
  // ring + ids; the entry then reaches the overlay over the ordinary module transport.
  // Payload: FeedReport. Fire-and-forget.
  feedReport: 'feed:report',

  // ---- celebration toasts (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md) ----
  // renderer(main app) -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "celebrate this" (ToastRequest). The producers
  // are the app's EXISTING always-mounted celebration detectors (T4), which already own the
  // live-only/replay-silence discipline — there is no second gate anywhere below this call.
  // The payload is VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (`validateToastRequest`, shared/toast.ts): unknown
  // kinds, over-long text and unlisted focus views are dropped, never forwarded to a window.
  // Main then RESOLVES the reward item card (lookupItem) and fans out on the two channels below.
  toastShow: 'toast:show',
  // main -> renderer(toast overlay): one resolved ToastPayload to render. The overlay times,
  // stacks and dismisses it locally and fetches NOTHING (T3/T5) — everything it draws is here.
  onToast: 'toast:card',
  // (`toast:sound` lived here until 2026-08-05. A toast has no voice of its own: the seeded
  // "Raid target defeated" / "Quest complete" ALERTS speak on the same events, and a second
  // channel could only ever say it twice. Removed with the sound controls it served.)

  // ---- cross-window deep link (Task #64) ----
  // renderer(overlay) -> main: "focus the app on this" (AppFocus). Main shows/restores/focuses
  // the MAIN window and forwards the payload on `onFocusView`. Fire-and-forget; the payload's
  // `view` is re-validated at the handler against the closed AppFocusView union.
  focusView: 'app:focusView',
  // main -> renderer(main app): a deep link landed. App.tsx switches to the named view and
  // hands the target down (today: the mob to drill into).
  onFocusView: 'app:focusedView',

  // ---- class-combo corrections (docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md § 5.3) ----
  // READS need no channel of their own — the combo module rides the generic module transport
  // (`module:getSnapshot('combo')` + `module:delta`). These two exist because a correction is a
  // WRITE: the user telling the app "that span was PAL/ROG/BER", which is persisted per
  // character and outlives every replay.
  // renderer -> main: record a correction. Payload {startTs, endTs, classes}. `classes` must be
  // a 1-3 list of the 16 ClassAbbr literals and the timestamps must be finite and ordered —
  // VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER, never trusted because today's only caller is the app's own UI.
  comboSetCorrection: 'combo:setCorrection',
  // renderer -> main: drop every correction overlapping [startTs, endTs] ("Reset to detected").
  // A TIME RANGE, not an interval id: ids are recompute-unstable by design (§ 5.4).
  comboClearCorrection: 'combo:clearCorrection',

  // ---- group-roster user edits (docs/plans/group-model.md §3) ----
  // Same shape as the combo pair above and for the same reason: the roster READS ride the
  // combat snapshot (which both the Combat tab and every overlay already poll), so only the
  // WRITES need channels. A roster edit is the user telling the app "this person is with me" or
  // "this person is not" — persisted per character, outliving every replay.
  // renderer -> main: record an edit. Payload {name, action}. The name is trimmed, length- and
  // shape-checked AT THE HANDLER (a renderer string is a renderer string) and canonicalized
  // there, so the store can never hold a key the model would not recognize.
  rosterSetEdit: 'roster:setEdit',
  // renderer -> main: forget the hand-made statement about one name — "let the log decide again".
  rosterClearEdit: 'roster:clearEdit',

  // NOTE: there are deliberately NO pet-claim channels here any more (JOS-49). The meter used to
  // ASK "<Name> — your pet?" about an unbound entity and take the answer over IPC; the owner cut
  // the question outright — "if you just have to pet attack once, this is a lot of work we can
  // get wrong." The private tell is the binding story, and it needs no renderer round trip.

  // ---- item knowledge ("what's this lore/quest item for", Task #53) ----
  // renderer -> main: look up an item's lore/quest knowledge (local posky-first, then a
  // cached, politely-throttled wiki lookup). Returns ItemKnowledge.
  itemsLookup: 'items:lookup',

  // ---- mob knowledge ("what does this thing drop", Task #63) ----
  // renderer -> main: look up a mob's drop knowledge (own loot history + local quest catalog
  // first, then a cached, politely-throttled wiki lookup). Returns MobKnowledge. Exposed on
  // BOTH bridges — the main window's "recently considered" card and the events overlay's
  // consider rows ask the same question of the same cache-first door.
  mobsLookup: 'mobs:lookup',

  // ---- exaltation planner (docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md §4.1, D1) ----
  // items.json is 7.14 MB and already inlined in MAIN's bundle, so the effect index is built
  // there and served over these channels rather than shipping the corpus to the renderer twice.
  // The index is built LAZILY on the first call and memoized for the process's lifetime.
  // renderer -> main: every effect the corpus states, one row per (item, effect). Returns
  // PlannerDonor[] (~1.5k rows, a few hundred KB) — fetched once and cached by the renderer.
  plannerDonors: 'planner:donors',
  // renderer -> main: substring search over item NAMES for the Board's host picker. Arg: query
  // (VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER — a non-string answers with no hits). Returns PlannerItemHit[],
  // capped at PLANNER_SEARCH_LIMIT.
  plannerSearchItems: 'planner:searchItems',
  // renderer -> main: the active character's saved exaltation sets. Returns ExaltPlan[] ([] when
  // the character has none — the key is optional and readers default, D4).
  plannerGetPlans: 'planner:getPlans',
  // renderer -> main: replace the active character's whole set list (plans are small). The
  // payload is re-validated AT THE HANDLER against the closed slot/socket/class allowlists
  // (src/main/planner/validate.ts) — renderer input is never trusted, here as everywhere.
  plannerSetPlans: 'planner:setPlans',
  // renderer -> main: what the active character is WEARING, read from their newest
  // `/outputfile inventory` dump and joined to the planner's slots by the hand-authored table in
  // shared/planner/inventorySlots.ts (V7, law 12). Returns PlannerInventory | null — null means
  // no dump exists, which the Inventory tab answers with its instructions card, never an error.
  // The dump is re-read on demand; the renderer re-asks when `inventory:autoReloaded` fires, so
  // typing the command in game fills the tab with no click anywhere.
  plannerInventory: 'planner:inventory',

  // ---- character sheet (JOS-45) ----
  // renderer -> main: the armory grid + the gear sum, built from the active character's newest
  // `/outputfile inventory` dump and joined to the committed item DB in main (where the 8.6 MB
  // corpus already lives). Returns CharacterSheet | null — null means no dump, which the tab
  // answers with its instructions card, never an error.
  //
  // THIS CHANNEL IS GATED. Its handler is registered only when `UNRELEASED` (src/main/unreleased.ts)
  // is true — dev builds, or an explicit EQ_UNRELEASED=1 — because the module has not passed the
  // owner's review gate. In a packaged build there is no handler and the preload method rejects,
  // which is the designed outcome: the renderer surface is stripped from those bytes entirely.
  characterSheet: 'character:sheet',

  // ---- map viewer (docs/plans/map-viewer.md §4.2) ----
  // Main owns `fs` and owns effectiveEqRoot(), so main reads and parses `<eqRoot>\maps` and
  // the renderer receives columnar typed arrays (~690 KB worst case, once per zone change).
  // `zone` and every packId reach a join() and are validated AT THE HANDLER (isSafePackId).
  // renderer -> main: the installed packs (no absolute paths). Returns MapPackListResult.
  mapsListPacks: 'maps:listPacks',
  // renderer -> main: zone stems, all packs or one. Args: (packId?). Returns ZoneShort[].
  mapsListZones: 'maps:listZones',
  // renderer -> main: one zone's parsed map. Args: (zone, prefs?) where prefs picks the pack
  // PER LAYER — geometry and labels routinely come from different packs (§6.3), and the
  // outcome is reported back in MapData.sources. Returns MapGetResult.
  mapsGet: 'maps:get',
  // renderer -> main: fuzzy label search — one zone (opts.zone) or the whole corpus.
  // Args: (query, opts?). Returns MapSearchHit[].
  mapsSearch: 'maps:search',

  // ---- settings / alert sharing ("profiles" — src/shared/profiles.ts) ----
  // Every call carries the renderer's whitelisted localStorage prefs (UI_PREF_SPECS): main
  // owns the electron-store half of a bundle, the renderer owns the localStorage half.
  // renderer -> main: encode the GLOBAL settings bundle. Args: (uiPrefs). Returns the string.
  shareExportSettings: 'share:exportSettings',
  // renderer -> main: encode one alert (ids:[id]) or all of them (ids omitted/empty).
  shareExportAlerts: 'share:exportAlerts',
  // renderer -> main: save an already-encoded string to a file via the OS save dialog.
  // Args: (text, suggestedName). Returns {ok, path?, canceled?}.
  shareSaveFile: 'share:saveFile',
  // renderer -> main: open a .eqshare/.txt via the OS picker and PREVIEW it. Args: (uiPrefs).
  shareOpenFile: 'share:openFile',
  // renderer -> main: decode + plan a pasted string WITHOUT writing anything. Args:
  // (text, uiPrefs). Returns SharePreview (never throws; failures come back as prose).
  sharePreview: 'share:preview',
  // renderer -> main: apply a previewed string additively. Args: (text, uiPrefs, selection).
  // Returns ShareApplyResult, incl. the localStorage writes the renderer must perform.
  shareApply: 'share:apply',

  // ---- clipboard (the combat "Copy this view as text" buttons) ----
  // renderer -> main: put plain text on the OS clipboard. Arg: text. Returns boolean (written).
  // WHY THIS IS AN IPC CHANNEL AND NOT `navigator.clipboard.writeText`: the async Clipboard API
  // is permission-gated in Chromium ('clipboard-sanitized-write'), and this app denies EVERY
  // web permission wholesale (`hardenSession` in src/main/windows.ts — deliberate, deny-by-
  // default policy). So writeText rejects with `NotAllowedError: Write permission denied.` in
  // every window, verified in the real app. Electron's main-process `clipboard` module is not a
  // web API and consults no permission, so the copy goes through here instead — the policy
  // stays shut and the feature works. The text is VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (non-empty string,
  // length cap), never trusted because today's only caller is the app's own UI.
  clipboardWrite: 'clipboard:write',

  // ---- in-app feedback (Task #65 — docs/plans/feedback-triage.md §4.3) ----
  // renderer -> main: the dialog's header context (versions, channel, queued count,
  // whether this build has an endpoint compiled in). Returns FeedbackContext.
  feedbackContext: 'feedback:context',
  // renderer -> main: build the scrubbed log slice for a window (minutes) and return a
  // CAPPED preview + the real counts. The bytes never cross IPC — only PREVIEW_MAX_LINES
  // of text plus the metadata. Returns FeedbackSlicePreview | null.
  feedbackBuildSlice: 'feedback:buildSlice',
  // renderer -> main: save the FULL slice to disk via the OS save dialog, so a user who
  // wants to read every byte before sending can. Returns {ok, path?, canceled?}.
  feedbackSaveSlice: 'feedback:saveSlice',
  // renderer -> main: submit. Args (draft, {attachLog, windowMinutes}). Never rejects;
  // a network failure resolves with {ok:false, queued:true}. Returns SubmitResult.
  feedbackSubmit: 'feedback:submit',

  // ---- usage analytics (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md wave A1) ------------------------
  //
  // NONE OF THESE CAN PUT A BYTE ON THE WIRE. They move events into the local ring, read and
  // write the switch, and render the payload viewer. The only thing that transmits is main's
  // flush loop, gated in src/main/telemetry/net.ts — there is no "send now" channel, on purpose.
  //
  // renderer -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: record one event. The payload is VALIDATED AT THE
  // HANDLER with the shared `validateTelemetryEvent` — the renderer is untrusted here like
  // everywhere else, and the schema is a closed allowlist, so an unknown tag or an unlisted
  // enum member is dropped rather than buffered. Arg: TelemetryEvent.
  telemetryTrack: 'telemetry:track',
  // renderer -> main: the persisted prefs {enabled, noticeShown, analyticsId}. Returns
  // TelemetryPrefs.
  telemetryPrefsGet: 'telemetryPrefs:get',
  // renderer -> main: flip the master switch. OFF drops the local buffer immediately.
  // Arg: boolean. Returns TelemetryPrefs.
  telemetrySetEnabled: 'telemetry:setEnabled',
  // renderer -> main: the first-run notice has been ANSWERED (or dismissed — dismissal keeps
  // it on, that is what opt-out means). Sets noticeShown either way. Arg: boolean (keep on).
  telemetryNoticeShown: 'telemetry:noticeShown',
  // renderer -> main: mint a new anonymous analyticsId and DROP the local buffer (T3).
  // Returns TelemetryPrefs.
  telemetryRotate: 'telemetry:rotate',
  // renderer -> main: everything the Preferences payload viewer renders — prefs, whether this
  // build has an endpoint at all, the live buffer, and the last batch sent (permanently null
  // while dark). Returns TelemetryPayloadView.
  telemetryPayload: 'telemetry:payload',

  // ---- what's new (JOS-73; shared/releaseNotes.ts) --------------------------------------
  //
  // TWO CHANNELS, AND THE NOTES THEMSELVES CROSS NEITHER. `src/shared/releaseNotes.ts` is
  // committed source that the bundler inlines into the renderer, exactly like the spell DB — so
  // the only thing main owns here is the ONE store key that says which release this install has
  // already been shown. Everything the user sees is derived from that string by a pure function.
  // renderer -> main: the stored last-seen release, or null on a fresh install. Returns string|null.
  releaseNotesSeenGet: 'releaseNotes:getSeen',
  // renderer -> main: stamp it (the panel, on open) or CLEAR it with null (the DEV variant
  // control's "pretend fresh install"). Arg: string|null, validated at the handler. Returns
  // what is now stored.
  releaseNotesSeenSet: 'releaseNotes:setSeen',

  // ---- performance HUD + startup profile (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md) ----------------
  //
  // NOTHING ON THIS CHANNEL SET COSTS ANYTHING WHILE THE HUD IS OFF. Main creates no timer at
  // all until `perf:setEnabled` says so, so an install that never opens the section never sees
  // a single `perf:sample`.
  //
  // main -> renderer, PUSH: one `PerfSample` every 2 s while the HUD is enabled — or `null`,
  // sent exactly once when it is switched off, which is how the title-bar chip learns to
  // disappear instead of freezing on the last numbers it saw.
  onPerfSample: 'perf:sample',
  // renderer -> main: the persisted HUD pref ({enabled}). Returns PerfHudPrefs.
  perfPrefsGet: 'perfPrefs:get',
  // renderer -> main: flip the HUD switch. Starts/stops the sampler in the SAME call, so the
  // pref and this session's timers can never disagree. A non-boolean leaves the pref alone.
  // Arg: boolean. Returns PerfHudPrefs.
  perfSetEnabled: 'perf:setEnabled',
  // renderer -> main: the last startup profile — the launch you are in (it is written to disk
  // for the next one). Returns StartupProfile. Read by Preferences → Performance.
  perfGetStartup: 'perf:getStartup',
  // renderer -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "the renderer has mounted" — the `rendererHydrated`
  // startup phase, which only the renderer can observe. Sent once per window lifetime; a
  // repeat is refused by the phase accounting itself (shared/perf.ts `addMark`).
  perfRendererHydrated: 'perf:rendererHydrated',

  // ---- graphics compatibility (JOS-40 — shared/graphicsPrefs.ts) ------------------------
  //
  // Two switches for machines whose driver dislikes what this app draws: software rendering
  // for the whole app, and opaque (non-transparent) overlay windows. NEITHER takes effect on
  // the call — safe mode is a before-`ready` flag (next launch) and a window's transparency is
  // fixed at construction (next overlay open) — so there is deliberately no "apply now" channel
  // to pretend otherwise.
  //
  // renderer -> main: the persisted blob {safeMode, opaqueOverlays}. Returns GraphicsPrefs.
  graphicsPrefsGet: 'graphicsPrefs:get',
  // renderer -> main: merge-patch the blob. VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER through the same
  // normalizer the store reader and the 9→10 migration use. Returns what was stored.
  graphicsPrefsSet: 'graphicsPrefs:set',

  // ---- dev restart (JOS-61, JOS-63 — src/main/devRestart.ts) ----------------------------
  //
  // renderer -> main: restart the app. Hand-testing startup performance means restarting it
  // over and over, and Preferences → Performance already prints the breakdown of the launch
  // you are in; this is the button beside that readout.
  //
  // The reply is a `DevRestartResult` (shared/devRestart.ts) rather than a boolean, because
  // there are three outcomes and they look different to the person who clicked: the process is
  // going away now, the electron-vite watcher has been ASKED to rebuild and relaunch us (a
  // couple of seconds, and the only route that does not blank the window under `npm run dev`),
  // or nothing happened at all.
  //
  // UNLIKE THE TRIAGE CHANNELS BELOW, THIS HANDLER IS REGISTERED IN EVERY BUILD — and REFUSES
  // in a packaged one, having done nothing (src/main/ipc/dev.ts). A packaged
  // build is therefore provably inert even if the channel is reached, rather than relying on
  // the renderer surface having been stripped (it has been: `DEV_TOOLS`, anchored on
  // `import.meta.env.DEV`, deletes the button from those bytes). Takes no arguments, so there
  // is nothing at this handler to validate.
  devRestart: 'dev:restart',

  // ---- feedback TRIAGE (the OWNER-only operator tab — src/main/triage/**) --------------
  //
  // ========= OWNER OPT-IN ONLY. NO SHIPPED APP EVER REGISTERS THESE HANDLERS. =============
  //
  // The names live here because every channel name in this app lives here — but nothing in a
  // packaged build listens on them, and since JOS-72 nothing in an ordinary dev build does
  // either. Registration happens from `src/main/index.ts` behind `if (!OWNER_TOOLS) return`
  // via a dynamic import — DEV **and** an explicit `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1` that no fresh checkout
  // has (src/shared/ownerTools.ts; a self-compiled build from this public repo is not
  // `app.isPackaged`, which is what the old predicate had missed) — and the module it imports
  // reaches `pg` + `@aws-sdk/*`, which are devDependencies and therefore never packaged.
  // Calling one of these from a shipped build rejects with "No handler registered", which is
  // the correct and intended outcome.
  //
  // These channels read the OWNER'S FEEDBACK BACKLOG (Aurora DSQL + S3) using the launching
  // shell's AWS profile (AWS_PROFILE, default 'eqc'). Possession of those IAM credentials is
  // the access control; there is no password and no server-side read API to secure.
  //
  // Every argument is VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (src/main/triage/validate.ts) — `reportId`
  // reaches a file path as well as a SQL parameter and must be a 26-character ULID. Every
  // reply is a `TriageResult<T>` (never a rejection), so an IAM denial renders as prose.
  //
  // renderer -> main: the filtered backlog. Arg: TriageListQuery. Returns TriageRow[].
  triageList: 'triage:list',
  // renderer -> main: one full record + the S3-resolved log state. Arg: reportId.
  triageDetail: 'triage:detail',
  // renderer -> main: download (cached) + gunzip a report's log slice and return CAPPED text.
  // The gz bytes never cross; at most PREVIEW_MAX_LINES lines do. Arg: reportId.
  triageSlice: 'triage:slice',
  // renderer -> main: the triage-only writes (status/severity/cluster/dupe/note). Args:
  // (reportId, TriagePatch). `issueUrl` is deliberately NOT writable from the UI.
  triagePatch: 'triage:patch',
  // renderer -> main: §3.5 forget — strip the contact, delete the slice object, keep the
  // report. Arg: reportId.
  triageForget: 'triage:forget',
  // renderer -> main: the kill switch + block list. Returns TriageOpsState.
  triageOps: 'triage:ops',
  // renderer -> main: set the kill switch. POSITIVE polarity — `accepting:false` is what the
  // CLI spells `closed on`. Args: (accepting, message?).
  triageSetAccepting: 'triage:setAccepting',
  // renderer -> main: block/unblock one install. Args: (installId, blocked, reason).
  triageSetBlocked: 'triage:setBlocked',
  // renderer -> main: the CLI's markdown digest + its deterministic clusters. Arg: query.
  triageDigest: 'triage:digest',
  // renderer -> main: usage analytics over a window (arg: days, one of TRIAGE_ANALYTICS_DAYS).
  // Reads usage_daily + usage_funnel_daily + analytics_install; `available:false` means the
  // tables are missing (a cluster that predates the A2 migration), NOT that they are empty.
  triageAnalytics: 'triage:analytics',

  onCharacter: 'log:character',
