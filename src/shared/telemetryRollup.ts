// ============================================================================
// TELEMETRY ROLLUP — the ONE definition of what a batch becomes once it lands.
// ============================================================================
//
// `./telemetry.ts` says what a client may SEND. This file says what the server may KEEP, and
// the two are deliberately different documents: the wire schema is a privacy promise, this is
// a storage decision (plan T6 — "ingest aggregates on arrival … no raw-event store at all").
//
// WHO READS IT, and why it is shared rather than living in the Lambda:
//   * `infra/lambda/telemetry.ts` — turns one validated batch into the UPSERT rows;
//   * `src/main/triage/analytics.ts` — reads those same rows back for the Analytics panel;
//   * `scripts/triage-feedback.mts analytics digest` — the text version of the same numbers;
//   * `scripts/dev-feedback-server.mts` — the local rehearsal of the ingest path.
//
// If the metric NAMES lived in the handler, the readout would be a second hand-typed copy of
// them, and the first typo would be a silently empty panel rather than a compile error. They
// live here, spelled once, and every reader imports them.
//
// PURE, like the contract: the only import is `./telemetry` (types, the closed enums and
// `bucketOf`). No `node:`, no Electron, no DOM — it bundles into a Lambda and compiles under
// both of the repo's tsconfigs.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT AN AGGREGATE CAN AND CANNOT ANSWER — read this before adding a panel row.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A daily counter keyed on (day, metric, dim) can answer "how many", "how much" and "how
// long" per day. It CANNOT answer anything that needs the identity behind the count:
//
//   * DISTINCT-PER-DAY is possible only where the ingest path already knows it is seeing an
//     id for the first time today — which it does, once, from the `analytics_install` UPSERT.
//     That is why `activeInstalls` (DAU) exists as a counter at all, and why the envelope
//     facts (version/channel/platform/tz) are counted ONLY on that first batch: counted per
//     batch they would measure flush loops, not people.
//   * WAU / MAU / retention are NOT unions of daily counters (an install active on Monday and
//     Tuesday would be counted twice). They are computed at READ time from
//     `analytics_install`, which is the one place a per-id fact survives.
//   * PER-FEATURE REACH ("what share of installs opened Maps") is not derivable here at all —
//     it would need per-id, per-feature state, which is exactly the per-user event trail T6
//     refused to keep. The panel reports uses and uses-per-session instead, and says so.
//   * A MEDIAN cannot be summed. So session length is kept twice: a total (for the mean) and
//     a HISTOGRAM over `SESSION_MS_EDGES` (for a median that is honest to a bucket, and is
//     rendered as a range rather than a fake exact number).

//
// WHOSE USE IS THIS? The owner runs this app too — a dev build all day, and the installed copy
// in the evening — and their own use is a real signal about the BUILD but pure noise in every
// number about the USER BASE. A three-install "population" of which one is the author is not a
// population. So every counter row carries a cohort and the read paths default to 'user'.
//
// SPLIT, NEVER SUMMED, NEVER DROPPED (the owner's words: "just split it out, but keep it").
// `--cohort all` and the tab's toggle render two readouts SIDE BY SIDE; nothing anywhere adds
// them together, because a merged total is precisely the number the split exists to stop
// reporting. And nothing deletes an owner row: it is the only usage data about a build the
// author actually drives hard, which makes it the best signal there is about the build itself.
//
// TWO WAYS A ROW BECOMES 'owner', and they are deliberately different mechanisms:
//
//   * THE DEV CHANNEL TAGS ITSELF, SERVER-SIDE, WITH NO CLIENT CHANGE. `env.channel` has been in
//     the envelope since the contract was written (TELEMETRY.md documents it; `foldEnvelope`
//     below already counts it), so the ingest path derives the cohort from a field it is
//     already handed. A dev build cannot belong to anyone but the author, so there is nothing to
//     mark and nothing to get wrong.
//   * THE INSTALLED COPY IS MARKED BY HAND, ONCE, BY analyticsId
//     (`triage-feedback analytics owner-add <id>`). NOTHING in a prod payload distinguishes the
//     author's install from anybody else's — that is the entire point of the id — so the mark
//     has to be server-side state on `analytics_install`, and the owner reads their id out of
//     the app's own payload viewer. A rotated id is a NEW id and needs re-marking; the CLI help
//     says so, because a silently unmarked owner is exactly the failure this feature exists to
//     prevent.
//
// FROM-MARKING-ONWARD IS THE HONEST SEMANTIC. A counter is an anonymous SUM with no id in it, so
// rows already aggregated under 'user' cannot be re-attributed after a marking and are left
// exactly alone. The digest states that in its header rather than letting the reader assume the
// split is retroactive.
