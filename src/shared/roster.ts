// THE GROUP ROSTER — who you are with, and how confident the app is about each name.
// docs/plans/group-model.md. Shared because three surfaces read it: the main-process module
// that builds it, the combat engine that consults it, and both renderer bundles that filter
// meters by it.
//
// THE ONE RULE THAT PROTECTS EVERYTHING ELSE (design doc §0): THE ROSTER NEVER TOUCHES THE
// PARSER. Every entity's damage is parsed and recorded exactly as before. The roster decides
// two things and no more:
//
//   1. ADMISSION — whether the engine books a group member's outgoing damage at all. This is
//      the widening of `classify()`'s gate that the reported bug needed (§3.5): 2,224 parsed
//      events fell through `attacker not you/pet, target not you → ignore`.
//   2. THE VIEW ALLOWLIST — which recorded rows the Group scope shows.
//
// So a WRONG roster can hide a row; it can never corrupt a number. Removing a member in the UI
// re-filters rows that are still recorded and still visible under Everyone; switching scope
// re-filters the same recorded truth. That is what "must not interfere with parser accuracy"
// means structurally, rather than as a promise.
//
// This module is PURE: zero imports, no `node:`, no Electron, no DOM. It compiles under both
// tsconfigs.

/**
 * WHERE A MEMBER CAME FROM, strongest first — the same provenance ladder the class-combo model
 * uses (user > stated > inferred). Rank, not just a label: a weaker signal never overwrites a
 * stronger one's provenance, so a member the user added by hand keeps saying so even after the
 * log confirms them.
 *
 *   'user'      you added them yourself in the roster popover. Outranks everything.
 *   'joined'    `<Name> has joined the group.` — the game said it outright.
 *   'stated'    `<Name> is now the leader of your group.` — the game named them in a role that
 *               only a member can hold. A fact, but about the role, not the join.
 *   'confirmed' `<Name> tells the group, '…'` — they are talking to your group, so they are in
 *               it. The FIRST recovery path: EQ prints the join line once, so a group formed
 *               before the app opened has no join line left to replay.
 *   'buffed'    your one Quick Buff burst landed on them while the log was paying you PARTY
 *               experience (JOS-85). THE SECOND RECOVERY PATH, and the weakest rung on purpose:
 *               `confirmed` needs somebody to TALK, which a quiet group never does and which
 *               shared/logScrub.ts strips from every artifact anyway, so a session could carry
 *               a whole group and name nobody. See src/main/modules/buffFanOut.ts for what is
 *               measured and src/main/modules/roster.ts for the party-experience gate that
 *               makes it precise. Any real membership line outranks it instantly.
