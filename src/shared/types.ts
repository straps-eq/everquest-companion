// the game. When the thing it named deserves a real answer — a con row's mob and everything it
// drops — the overlay's job ends and the MAIN WINDOW's begins. This is the payload that hands
// off: the overlay asks main to focus the app on a view, main shows/focuses the window and
// forwards the same payload to the app's renderer, which switches tabs and drills.
//
// Deliberately a small, CLOSED union rather than a route string: a renderer window asking
// another window to navigate is a capability, and the set of destinations it may name is
// spelled out here (and re-validated at the IPC handler) instead of being whatever text the
// asking window happened to send.
