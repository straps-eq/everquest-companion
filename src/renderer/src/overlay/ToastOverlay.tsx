// ToastOverlay — the 'toast' overlay kind (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md).
//
// A transparent strip at the top of the screen that USUALLY RENDERS NOTHING. Main pushes one
// finished payload per celebration (`toast:card`); this component queues, times and dismisses
// it locally. It is a sibling of OverlayMeter / EventLogOverlay in the same overlay.html bundle
// (kind from `?kind=`), so it inherits their per-kind config, their persisted bounds and their
// lock semantics — and, being MUI-free like them, it stays cheap to paint over the game.
//
// ALL THE TIMING IS IN toastQueue.ts, as a pure reducer over an explicit `dtMs`. This file owns
// exactly one interval and one rule about the mouse.
//
// THE MOUSE RULE (T2): the window is PERSISTENT while enabled and fully click-through when the
// queue is empty — an invisible strip must never eat a click meant for the game. The moment a
// card is on screen the renderer asks main to flip `setIgnoreMouseEvents(false)` so hover-pin
// and the reward click work, and it flips back the moment the last card leaves. Only while
// LOCKED: an unlocked (interactive) toast is being positioned, and must keep the pointer.
//
// INTERACTIVE MODE is how you move it. Locked, there is nothing to grab — by design, since the
// window is empty most of the time. Unlocked (Preferences → Overlays → "Move the toast"), the
// strip shows its outline and a drag bar, so "configurable position later" is the mechanism
// every other overlay already has rather than a new one.
//
// THE ONE EXCEPTION TO "RENDERS NOTHING" IS THE INTRODUCTION (JOS-83, `useIntroduction` below):
// the first time this overlay ever comes up on an install it queues ONE card naming itself, so a
// user who has never triggered a celebration is not left staring at an anonymous rectangle.

 *
 * A brand-new user reported the celebration strip as a rectangle they took for a malfunction —

 * say what it is. Painting a permanent label would trade that rare confusion for a constant one
 * (an empty, invisible, click-through strip is exactly why the kind can default on), so the
 * overlay introduces itself ONCE, through the queue it already has: a labelled card with the same
 * close button as every other, plus a button that switches the overlay off for good.
 *
 * ONCE PER INSTALL, and the flag is written the moment the card is queued rather than when it
 * leaves: a second window (or a reload) mid-introduction must not stack a second copy, and the
 * store is the only place two renderers can agree. A store with no `introduced` key reads false,
 * so installs that predate this see it too — they are precisely the ones that have been living
 * with the unlabelled strip.
