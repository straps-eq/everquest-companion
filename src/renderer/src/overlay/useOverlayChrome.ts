// useOverlayChrome — the window plumbing every overlay KIND shares, in one place.
//
// All five overlays (damage fight/overall, healing fight/overall, event log) are the same
// window with a different body: a persisted config (position, background alpha, TEXT SIZE, lock
// AND the drill-down), a lock toggle that flips click-through, and the hover dance that briefly
// re-captures the mouse over a LOCKED overlay so its own controls stay reachable. This hook is
// that plumbing; each overlay file keeps only its header, selector and body.
//
// It REMEMBERS the text size and applies none of it: the scale goes on the content pane and not
// on the chrome, so the placement belongs to the surface (overlayScale.tsx).
//
// CONFIG IS THE STATE. `patch` writes locally first (so the UI moves this frame) and then
// through to main, which echoes it back over onConfig — there is no second copy to drift, and
// a drill survives a restart exactly like window position does.
//
// MUI-FREE ON PURPOSE: the overlay is its own renderer entry (overlay.html) with no theme and
// no component library. Do not import @mui/* into this bundle.

/**
 * WHY A LOCKED OVERLAY EVER CAPTURES THE MOUSE, and why the reason has a NAME.
 *
 * Locked means `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})`: clicks go to the game, and the
 * renderer still receives mouse MOVES — that forwarding is the hover sensor, and it is already
 * on for every meter kind (windows.ts spells out why the toast is the one kind that does not
 * pay for it). When something under the cursor genuinely needs a click, the renderer asks main
 * to stop ignoring; when it stops needing one, it asks again. No new WH_MOUSE_LL hook is
 * involved in any of this — nothing here changes what forwards.
 *
 * The reasons are NAMED because more than one can be true at once and they end at different
 * moments. The selector popup is the case that forced it (P3): the popup is `position: fixed`
 * and therefore NOT inside the header row, so moving the pointer from the header down into the
 * open list fires the header's `mouseleave` — and a single boolean would drop capture out from
 * under the very list the user is reaching for. Two reasons, released independently, cannot.
 *
 *   'window'   — the pointer is anywhere over the overlay. The whole-window sensor the event log
 *                and the pre-P3 meters use: everything is capturable while hovered.
 *   'selector' — the pointer is over the SELECTOR ROW specifically (P3). The meters use this
 *                instead of 'window', so a locked meter's BODY stays genuinely click-through.
 *   'popup'    — the selector's list is open. Outlives 'selector' by construction (above).
