// ============================================================================
// releaseChart.ts — the release-health chart's geometry, as pure functions (JOS-96).
// ============================================================================
//
// Same discipline as `analyticsRows.ts` beside it: everything that DECIDES something — where a
// vertex lands, whether a line breaks, what the axis maximum is — is a pure function here, so
// `tests/usageAnalytics.test.mts` can assert it with no React and no DOM. The .tsx is layout.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE TIME BASE (world-model law 9), and here it is the DAY INDEX
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `TriageAnalyticsData.days` is dense and ascending, and every series in this section is already
// aligned to it by `buildReleaseHealth`. So x is `index / (days-1)` for the curves, the adoption
// band and the release markers ALIKE — one mapping, computed once, used by all three. The bug
// this rule exists to prevent (markers swimming against a still curve, 5a9dbc2) is precisely what
// would happen here if the markers were placed by parsing their date into a wall-clock fraction
// while the curves were placed by index.
//
// A release marker whose date is not IN the window is dropped rather than clamped to an edge: a
// marker pinned to day zero reads as "this shipped at the start of the window", which for a
// release from three months ago is a lie the chart tells confidently.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A GAP IS NOT A ZERO — why these are paths and not polylines
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `<polyline>` cannot express a break, so a day with no health report would have to be drawn at
// SOME height, and every available height is a claim: 0 says "no errors that day", the previous
// value says "unchanged", and interpolating says "we measured in between". All three are
// fabrications about a day nobody reported.
//
// So the rate curve is a `<path>` whose `d` starts a NEW SUBPATH (`M`) after every null. A build
// that stopped reporting leaves a visible hole, and a build that never reported at all produces
// an EMPTY string — nothing is drawn, and the legend says "not reporting" instead. That is the
// house rule made geometric rather than editorial.
