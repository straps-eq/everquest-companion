// ============================================================================
// ReleaseHealthSection — "did I release buggy code", on one time base (JOS-96).
// ============================================================================
//
// A NEW SECTION BESIDE Health / Startup / Versions, not a rework of any of them. Those answer
// what goes wrong, how launches went, and who is on what; this one puts the error rate, the
// adoption it happened to, and the release dates on a single x-axis so the reader can see which
// build a change of behaviour started in.
//
// It renders and nothing else: every vertex, break, marker position and axis maximum comes from
// `./releaseChart.ts`, which is pure and pinned by tests/usageAnalytics.test.mts. That split is
// the same one `analyticsRows.ts` has, for the same reason.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE HOUSE RULE, AS IT LANDS ON SCREEN
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A build that predates the emitting client sends nothing, and to a SUM that is indistinguishable
// from a build that reported perfectly and found no errors. If this panel let those two share a
// rendering it would show the entire back catalogue as flawless, which is the exact inverse of
// what is known about it. So:
//
//   * NOT REPORTING HAS ITS OWN VISUAL LANGUAGE — a dashed swatch, the words "not reporting",
//     and NO CURVE ON THE CHART. A true zero is a solid swatch, a drawn line sitting on the
//     floor of the rate axis, and the numeral 0.
//   * COVERAGE IS ALWAYS ON SCREEN, above the chart and again as its own band beneath it: what
//     share of the fleet was running a build that could have told us. An error curve at 20%
//     coverage is a rumour, and the reader can see that it is without doing arithmetic.
//   * THE RATE IS A DASH, NEVER A ZERO, wherever it is unknown — `rateLabel`'s standing rule in
//     this panel, applied to the one table where the difference is the whole point.
//
// BUG REPORTS ARE A SEPARATE COLUMN, never added to the error counts. They are a different kind
// of evidence (a person was annoyed enough to type something) and they exist for EVERY build ever
// shipped, including the ones with no health reporting — which makes them the only signal about
// those builds, and the reason this section is useful during the rollout rather than after it.
