// of truth: the wizard uses it to build defs AND to detect already-created suggestions
// (checked/disabled), and AGENTS.md documents it.
//
// ID CONVENTION:  `suggest:<spellKey>:<template>`
//   spellKey = the catalog entry's canonical (lowercased, rank-stripped) key.
//   template ∈ 'wearsOff' | 'fade' | 'lands'.
//   Illusion is the SHARED, deduped suggestion `suggest:illusion:fade` (one alert for the
//   generic `Your illusion fades.` line, which names no spell — see logEvents.ts IllusionFade).
//
// Each template's trigger was validated to actually fire in the AlertsModule against a
// matching synthetic LogEvent (scripts/_task38_harness.mts): the `where.spell` matcher tests
// the event's `spell` field case-insensitively; illusionFade carries no spell field, so its
// suggestion has no `where`.
