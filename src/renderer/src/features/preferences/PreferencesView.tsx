// PreferencesView — the app's single settings surface (Task #55).
//
// Replaces the old SettingsDialog (EQ install folder) and the drawer's update-channel
// selector: everything app-level lives here, reached from the drawer's bottom-aligned
// "Preferences" item, the title-bar gear, and the fresh-machine empty state.
//
// Layout: a [section rail | content] split, where the rail is a TRUE SWITCHER — one
// section is mounted at a time. (It was originally a scroll-spy page: every section
// rendered at once and the rail called scrollIntoView. Inside the app's overflow:auto
// content area the scroll barely moved and `active` never followed, so the rail read
// as dead and the tab as one endless column. That machinery is gone.)
//
// A DEEP LINK LANDS VISIBLY. `section` switches the rail silently, which is the wrong
// ending for a sentence the user clicked somewhere else ("Set up in Preferences", the
// telemetry notice's details link): the page arrives and nothing says which of these cards
// was the answer. The landed section's cards PULSE on arrival and settle — that lives in
// ./PrefSectionBlock.tsx, together with the card it decorates.
//
// SEARCH IS AN EXPLICIT MODE, not the default rendering. The field sits at the top of
// the content column so it lines up with the cards it filters; it echoes instantly from
// local state and filters a DEFERRED copy (AGENTS.md search pattern). While the query is
// non-empty the content column shows matches from EVERY section, each still under its
// section overline so a hit always carries its context; section labels match too, so
// typing "updates" pulls that whole section in. The rail keeps listing every section,
// dims the ones with no matches, and clicking any row exits search mode back to that
// section.
//
// Sections:
//   Game     — EverQuest install-folder discovery/override (effective path + how it
//             resolved + a folder picker + character-log validation). Lives in
//             ./EqFolderSetting.tsx, like Updates does — this file only names it.
//   Overlays — when the floating meters get out of the way: hide them while EverQuest isn't
//             running (on by default) and/or while it isn't the window you're in (off).
//             Lives in ./OverlayAutoHideSetting.tsx.
//   Graphics — the two compatibility switches for a machine whose graphics driver dislikes what
//             this app draws: software rendering (next launch) and solid, non-transparent
//             overlays (next overlay open). Lives in ./GraphicsSetting.tsx, descriptor and all.
//   Cursor ring — the opt-in white halo that follows the mouse over the EQ window (off by
//             default; size + thickness). Lives in ./CursorRingSetting.tsx.
//   Voice    — spoken alerts (docs/plans/voice-alerts.md §2): engine tier, default voice +
//             preview, speed and volume. There is no master switch — an alert's own output is
//             what makes it speak (schema v8). Lives in ./VoiceSetting.tsx.
//   Profiles — export your GLOBAL settings as a paste-safe share string / file, and import
//             someone else's ADDITIVELY (see src/shared/profiles.ts for the data model).
//   Updates — app version, last-checked time, a manual check, background download
//             progress, and the "Relaunch to update" action when one is waiting.
//             Lives in ./UpdateSetting.tsx; this file only names it in the table.
//   What's new — the browsable release history, newest first, with everything since this
//             install last read it marked new. A reading surface with no controls, which is why
//             it is a section rather than a line under Updates (the same argument Performance
//             and Usage analytics make). Lives in ../whatsnew/WhatsNewPanel.tsx, descriptor and
//             all; the Version row above links straight to it.
//   Usage analytics — the anonymous-counts switch, the rotatable id, and the payload
//             viewer that makes the privacy claim checkable. ./TelemetrySetting.tsx.
//   Performance — the title-bar CPU/memory HUD switch (off by default) and the read-only
//             breakdown of how long this launch's startup took, phase by phase.
//             Lives in ./PerfSetting.tsx.
//   Feedback — the second entry point into the feedback DIALOG (the first is the nav
//             drawer's footer). Feedback is not a view, so this section only opens it.

/**
 * Pet nesting (owner direction, 2026-08-03). ON by default: the game is mostly played solo, so
 * "you and your pet" is the shape of nearly every fight, and a two-row source meter is a lid on
 * the only list worth reading. Combined, the pet is ONE line item inside your breakdown —
 * labelled with its real name, drillable into its own skills, and never summed into a skill row
 * of yours (features/combat/petRows.ts). Off, it is a separate source row, as it always was.
 *
 * IT IS THE PET'S LAYOUT, NOT A ZOOM (owner ruling, 2026-08-05 — JOS-35). Every meter opens on
 * level 1 whatever this says; what it decides is WHERE the pet's damage lives. On ⇒ inside your
 * level-1 bar, and once more as a drillable line item in your breakdown — never a source row of
 * its own, so a fight's damage is never listed twice. Off ⇒ the pet keeps its own bar and
 * nothing is nested.
 *
 * ONE SWITCH, EVERY DAMAGE METER (owner ruling, 2026-08-04 — the floating overlay used to render
 * the engine's own pet fold instead, and showed a different breakdown for the same fight). The
 * Combat tab, the Overview card and the floating overlay meters all read THIS value and build
 * their rows with `petRows.meterPanel`.
 *
 * Renderer-local (localStorage, like the Fight/Overall scope), so it needs no store migration —
 * and it applies LIVE, across windows: same-window readers are notified directly, and the overlay
 * windows are same-origin, so they get the DOM's own 'storage' event (useCombatPrefs.ts).
