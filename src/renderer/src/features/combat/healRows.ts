// HEALING ROWS — THE one builder every healing meter calls, and every word it prints.
//
// It is to the healing meter exactly what `petRows.meterPanel` is to the damage meter (owner
// ruling, 2026-08-04, generalized by P1/P2 of docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md): the Combat
// tab's Healing dimension and the two floating heal overlays render from THIS function, so a
// second answer to "what is my sustain" has nowhere left to live. Before P2 the panel had no
// healing at all and the overlay had all of it — the divergence was total rather than subtle.
//
// MUI-FREE AND JSX-FREE ON PURPOSE. The overlay is its own renderer entry (overlay.html) with no
// theme and no component library, so a shared abstraction has to be plain TS to be importable
// from both bundles. Colors, bar chrome and crumbs stay in each surface; the LEVELS, the
// RANKING and the WORDS are here.
//
// THE STRINGS ARE PART OF THE SHARED SEAM, not a convenience. Every honesty rule the healing UI
// keeps — "absorption is GRANTED, not consumed", "a rune has no overheal and one is never
// invented for it", "overheal is a FLOOR summed only from the lines that carried the raw
// amount" — is a sentence, and two surfaces phrasing them differently is exactly how one of
// them ends up saying something the log cannot support. One phrasing, two renderers.
//
// HOW DEEP THE DRILL GOES, AND WHY IT STOPS THERE. The model has exactly two levels:
//   1  the ranked HEALERS of you and your pets (`HealingView.healers`)
//   2  ONE healer's flat lane list (`HealSourceView.spells`) — heal spells and the absorption
//      lane together, ranked by amount, told apart by `classification`.
// There is no third level and this file invents none. `HealSpellView` has no children: a heal
// line names a spell and an amount, and per-target or per-tick splits are not in the log at all
// (HoT ticks are byte-identical to direct heals — see the model header in shared/combat.ts).
// The damage meter's extra depth comes from a category rollup healing simply does not have.
