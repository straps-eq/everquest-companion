// THE TYPED-/loc MARKER — one dot, in a colour nothing else on this surface uses (JOS-98).
//
// A THIRD AUTHORITY NEEDS A THIRD SYMBOL. The surface already carries two, and a user must never
// have to ask which source a mark came from:
//
//   * the MAP FILE's own labels — round dots in the pack author's colours, because those colours
//     ENCODE a category (zone connection, banker, merchant…) and recolouring them destroys meaning;
//   * the WIKI's spawn pins, the search-jump flash and the selection ring — all the theme's warning
//     tone, because they are all "the app found this for you".
//
// This is neither. It is the one position on the map the USER stated, so it takes the theme's info
// tone and a crosshair rather than a pin or a ring — a shape that reads as "this exact point"
// rather than "something is around here". It is also the only mark on the surface that PERSISTS
// across a restart, which is the other reason it cannot look like the search flash.
//
// INERT, like the label and pin layers: `pointerEvents:'none'` on the frame so drag-to-pan works
// straight through it, re-enabled on the crosshair itself so its tooltip works. Clearing it is
// deliberately NOT a click on the map — the toolbar's chip owns that, next to the box the loc was
// typed into, so the affordance sits where the user's attention already is and a stray click on a
// map can never delete something they typed.
