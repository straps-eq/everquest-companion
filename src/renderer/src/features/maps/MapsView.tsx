// The Maps tab (docs/plans/map-viewer.md §10, §11 wave 3) — the view that resolves WHICH zone to
// show and hands everything about the drawing to MapBody.tsx.
//
// AUTO-OPEN, AND THE ONE THING IT MUST NEVER DO. The log states the zone you are in and nothing
// else positional, so the feature's whole "it just knows" is one fold: `CharacterSnap.zone` (the
// raw long name, off the `You have entered X.` line) → `zoneShortName()` → the map-file stem.
// That table is HAND-AUTHORED because there is no algorithm — measured, naive normalization
// resolves 7 of the 51 zone names the real log has printed ("The Plane of Sky" → `airplane`).
// When it returns null the viewer draws no map and SAYS WHICH NAME it could not place. It never
// guesses a stem: a confidently wrong map is worse than an honest question (world-model law 1).
// The EQL Tutorial is the known unmapped zone and is exactly what that state exists for.
//
// AND THE WAY OUT IS ALWAYS ON SCREEN. The toolbar's Zone selector (MapZoneSelect.tsx) renders
// in every state — map or no map — so browsing to a zone you are not standing in, and leaving
// the map you are on, are the same one control rather than a state you have to fall back into.
// A pick made there PINS (JOS-97): it survives the next zone line, leaving the tab, and a
// restart, until the toolbar's `Current zone` hands the choice back to the log. Which of the two
// is deciding is stated beside the selector — `useZoneSelection` below, rules in zoneFollow.ts.
//
// FINDING ANYTHING IS THE SIDEBAR'S JOB, and it is OPEN BY DEFAULT (MapMobPane.tsx). The toolbar
// used to carry a label-search box and a This zone / All zones toggle beside the sidebar's own
// toggle — three controls over one question, answered in two places. The bar now describes the
// DRAWING and nothing else; the sidebar is the one filter over the wiki's bestiary, this map's
// own labels and every other installed map.
//
// WHAT THIS VIEW CANNOT DO, AND THE HALF OF IT THE USER CAN (JOS-98). There is no AUTOMATIC "you
// are here" marker and there cannot be: `Your Location` appears ZERO times in the log — re-measured
// across the owner's whole 116.8 MB of it for this ticket — because /loc answers in the game window
// and is never written to the file the app tails. What the viewer can do is take the answer from
// you: the toolbar's `/loc marker` field accepts the line the game printed, drops a crosshair where
// it says, and keeps it there per zone until you replace it or clear it. The caption states exactly
// that pair, because a user hunting for a dot that does not exist is a worse outcome than one quiet
// line saying so (§10) — and a user who does not know they can place one is the report we got.
//
// TWO DENSITY CONTROLS LIVE HERE AND BOTH ARE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE. Labels declutter
// themselves (`labelLayout.ts`) — a label that loses its space becomes a dot and hover raises the
// text, so nothing is deleted. Floors are CLUSTERED from the map file's own elevations
// (`floorSlice.ts`) and stepped through by hand: the in-game height filter follows your
// character, and the log never says where that is, so there is no auto-select and the default is
// All levels. Out-of-band geometry DIMS rather than disappearing — a floor with its surroundings
// deleted is a diagram you cannot place.
