// The renderer's DOOR to the map IPC, plus the two prefs the viewer remembers between launches
// (docs/plans/map-viewer.md §4.3, §11 wave 3).
//
// Nothing here parses anything. Main owns `fs`, owns `effectiveEqRoot()` and owns the parse LRU
// (src/main/maps/packs.ts), so a zone arrives as one already-columnar `MapData` — this module's
// whole job is to ask for the right one, to ignore the answer to a question that has since been
// superseded, and to keep the asking honest while it is in flight.
//
// TWO RULES IT EXISTS TO ENFORCE:
//
//   * ONE IN-FLIGHT ANSWER WINS, AND IT IS THE LATEST QUESTION'S. Zoning twice quickly (or
//     clicking two search hits) fires two `maps:get` calls, and IPC gives no ordering guarantee
//     across invokes. Each effect run captures a `cancelled` flag, so a superseded reply is
//     dropped rather than painted over the newer map. There is no renderer-side cache to
//     invalidate: re-asking is an LRU hit in main.
//   * A FAILURE IS DATA. `maps:get` answers `{ok:false, error}` for the ordinary "this machine
//     has no map file for that zone" case, and the view renders that as a quiet state. Nothing
//     in this module throws, and the `.catch` exists only for a torn-down bridge.
//
// PREFS ARE MACHINE-LOCAL, IN `localStorage`, AND DELIBERATELY NOT IN `UI_PREF_SPECS`: which map
// packs are installed and which zone you were last standing in are facts about THIS install, so
// sharing them through a settings bundle would hand another machine a pack id it does not have
// (map-viewer.md §11 wave 3). The keys sit under the `eq.maps.` prefix like every other
// renderer-local view pref (`eq.view`, `eq.combat.scope`).
//
// THE ZONE ITSELF IS NOT ONE OF THEM ANY MORE. `eq.maps.zone` moved to `zoneFollow.ts` (JOS-97),
// where it lives beside the MODE that says what it means — a followed zone and a pinned one are
// stored the same way and behave completely differently, so the two keys are read and written
// together, by pure functions a node test can drive without React.
