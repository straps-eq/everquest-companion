 * Boss kills: useBossKills gates out the historical baseline. This is the SINGLE

 * the alerts extension. ONE callback carries all three surfaces — snackbar, sound and toast
 * fire on any roster kill CREDITED to you, repeats included, matching the confetti the Boss
 * tab bursts. A boss killed by a stranger in open world is tracked and celebrated by nobody
 * (owner, 2026-08-05); the credit test is the log's own experience line, which is also why a
 * GROUP kill still celebrates — party experience is experience.
 *
 * It used to be two (Task #24): the sound rode a narrower `onNewDefeat` — first kill at a new
 * instance tier — so the app cheered a repeat kill on screen and said nothing. Retired by the
 * owner 2026-08-04: "every time is worth celebrating." The alert's own cooldown is the rate
 * limit now, and fireAppSignal applies it, so even if the Boss tab's own detector fires in
 * the same instant it can't double-play.
 *
 * Sky turn-ins: useProgress seeds a silent baseline on the first hydrated snapshot, so
 * historical completions on load never fire — only a live turn-in transition does
 * (Task #46). This is the SINGLE always-mounted place we fire the 'questComplete' app
 * signal (sound) + the app-wide snackbar; PoskyView's own useProgress additionally bursts
 * confetti when that tab is open, and the shared cooldown stops a double-play. It is also
 * the ONE place a quest completion is reported into the live event feed (Task #59) — only
 * the renderer can match turn-ins against the posky dataset, so main can't detect this
 * itself. The report carries the QUEST link (the class's Plane of Sky Tests wiki page —
 * there are no per-quest pages) and, when the dataset names one, the reward item for the
 * event overlay's hover card. A quest with no known reward reports none: no fabricated
 * item (law 1).
