// The combat engine: a formal state machine over the log stream.
//
// State it maintains (see state.ts — EngineState):
//   petNames: Set<name>           — names of your ACTIVE pets, charmed OR summoned
//                                   (name-keyed). This is purely an ATTRIBUTION set —
//                                   it is NOT a charm roster. The world model owns the
//                                   charmed/summoned distinction (Instance.petKind).
//   zone:     string              — current zone (resets the overall aggregate)
//   current:  Encounter | null    — the in-progress/most-recent fight
//   history:  Encounter[]         — finalized fights
//   zoneAgg:  Agg                 — damage aggregated for the whole zone
//
// Transitions (one per ingested line — see ingest.ts):
//   zone     → finalize current, reset zoneAgg
//   charm    → petNames.add(mob) ONLY when charmModel.ts says the broadcast resolved one of
//              YOUR OWN casts. `<mob> has been charmed.` is a caster-less BROADCAST the whole
//              zone sees (it is the spell DB's msg_cast_on_other), so an unarmed one is
//              another player's pet and is dropped.
//   petClaim → petNames.add(name) (`<Name> told you, '… Master.'` — the ONLY binding
//              signal for a random-named SUMMONED class pet; charmed mobs send it too, and
//              it PROMOTES a name we saw charmed but declined to bind)
//   uncharm/death(charm spell/mob death) → petNames.delete(mob)
//   cc     → mark the mob's instance engaged + CC-held (mez/root keep-alive) — same ownership
//            gate: a foreign mez broadcast is inert.
//   damage → route to current encounter + zoneAgg (see routing.ts route())
//
// Attribution rule (damage `A → B` for N) — routing.ts classify():
//   A = You            → your outgoing
//   A ∈ petNames       → your pet's outgoing (unless B is friendly)
//   B = You            → incoming
//   otherwise          → not your fight (ignored)
//
// Encounter segmentation (Task #20 — death-closed, replacing the old idle-gap
// rule; the rules and their tuning constants live in encounter.ts, the evaluation in
// lifecycle.ts evalClosure). A fight CLOSES when either:
//   - every engaged hostile instance is GONE (retired = dead/zoned; or still alive but
//     with no PRESENCE evidence for PRESENCE_GONE_MS) AND LINGER_MS passes with no new
//     attributed damage → crisp pull boundaries from the death timeline. A multi-mob
//     pull is therefore ONE encounter: killing one add cannot close it while another is
//     demonstrably still swinging/casting/being healed (Task #55).
//   - OR no attributed damage AND no CC event for FALLBACK_IDLE_MS (fled/deagro).
// A CC (mez/root) application or refresh HOLDS the encounter open regardless of
// damage gaps while the CC'd instance is alive (the mez-and-wait case). Pet swap
// (uncharm/charm) is NOT a boundary event. Closure is time-driven, so it's evaluated
// both on the next ingested event and in snapshot(now) — finalization always stamps
// the encounter's own lastTs (a damage ts), never the eval moment. DPS uses
// (lastHit − firstHit), so it freezes when a fight ends. Each encounter also tracks
// activeMs (Σ capped gaps between hits) for an active-time DPS stat.
//
// Seeding: the engine is fed the entire log on load (recording=false) so charm
// and encounter state reflect reality before the live tail (recording=true)
// takes over — this is why a pet charmed before the app opened is still tracked.
//
// THIS FILE is the public face of all of that: one `CombatEngine` object owning one
// EngineState, plus snapshot assembly. Everything else is a module beside it —
// aggregate.ts (accumulators), encounter.ts (record types + constants), state.ts,
// ingest.ts (the switch), routing.ts / procRouting.ts (where a line lands),
// lifecycle.ts (when a segment opens/closes), sourceViews.ts + segmentViews.ts
// (serialization), healing.ts, fightSearch.ts, world.ts, taxonomy.ts.
