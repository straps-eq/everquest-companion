// THE INGEST SWITCH — one canonical LogEvent in, one state transition out. Extracted
// verbatim from engine.ts and split along the three event FAMILIES the original switch
// already grouped its cases into:
//
//   ingestWorld    — epoch / zone / charm / petClaim / uncharm / cc / death: the
//                    entity and segmentation lifecycle.
//   ingestCombat   — damage / heal / healUnstated / mitigation / miss / resist: the meter itself.
//   ingestCast     — castBegin / fizzle / interrupt: the own-cast lifecycle both ownership
//                    inferences (cast-less procs, charm/CC binding) run off.
//   ingestChoice   — stance / invocation / active special attack: the character's STANDING
//                    choices, which persist across pulls and zones until the game prints a
//                    different one. Not events in a fight; they change what a swing MEANS.
//   ingestModifier — coats / procs / dispel landings / Quick Buff / your own death: annotations.
//
// The families are disjoint on `ev.kind`, so the chain is exactly the old switch: each tries
// its own cases and reports whether it consumed the event. Any other kind is ignored.

 * …`), so the parser can only ever answer "Melee" for them. This applies the log's OWN statement
 * of which special is live in that verb's lane (specialAttacks.ts holds the state and the
 * evidence). It is a pure RENAME of `skill`: the amount, the type, the category and the
 * attribution are untouched, so every damage total stays byte-identical (law 8's tripwire).
 *
 * Gated on the attacker being YOU. The state line is first-person-only, so nothing is known
 * about anyone else's specials, and a mob's `strikes` must stay generic melee.
 *
 * Returns the SAME object when nothing changes — a fresh copy otherwise, never a mutation: the
 * canonical LogEvent is shared with every other module on the bus and the engine does not own it.
