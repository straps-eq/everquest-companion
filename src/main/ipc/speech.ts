// IPC: voice alerts / text-to-speech (docs/plans/voice-alerts.md §3).
//
// WAVE 3 FILLED THESE IN. The three engine channels were honest stubs through W1/W2 — the
// shapes below are byte-for-byte the ones they returned, so nothing the renderer was written
// against changed; only the bodies did:
//
//   speech:say      → {ok:true, url:'eqspeech://<sha256>'} once the wav exists,
//                     else {ok:false, reason} — and W2's renderer still degrades any
//                     {ok:false} to the system voice. THAT SEAM IS THE POINT: an alert is
//                     never silent because a model is missing, mid-download or broken.
//   speech:voices   → the voices the DOWNLOADED pack actually contains (see below).
//   speech:install  → runs the pinned provisioner, streaming progress on
//                     `speech:installProgress` while the one invoke is outstanding.
//
// THE VOICES-STATE DECISION (W2 flagged that "not installed" was being INFERRED from an empty
// list, and asked for a real state). Answer: the empty list IS the real state, and it is kept
// — `speech:voices` still returns `SpeechVoice[]`, and W2's `useVoices.ts` is untouched.
//
// The reasoning is that for this tier the two facts are the same fact, not an inference from
// one to the other. A Kokoro voice is not a capability the engine advertises; it is a style
// vector inside `voices-v1.0.bin`. No file ⇒ there are literally zero voices, and that is a
// complete and accurate inventory, not a proxy for one. (Contrast the SYSTEM tier, where an
// empty `getVoices()` genuinely IS ambiguous — "still loading" vs "none" — which is exactly
// why `lib/speech.ts` does the `voiceschanged` dance there and does not here.)
//
// The finer states a UI might still want — mid-download, download failed, model present but
// the worker won't start — are reported where they happen and can be distinguished:
// `speech:installProgress` carries phase + message for the first two, and `speech:say`'s
// `reason` for the third. A discriminated `{installed:false}` return would have had to change
// the shared type, the preload, `useVoices.ts` AND the preferences panel that renders from
// it — three of which are owned elsewhere this wave — to express something the existing
// channels already say. Documented here rather than done.
//
// PROVISIONING IS USER-INITIATED, ONCE AT A TIME, AND NEVER IN E2E. `speech:install` is the
// only path that downloads (~120 MB, plan decision D4). A second call while one is running
// joins the first rather than opening a second connection — the scraper-etiquette LAW's "one
// connection" applied to the door, not just to the fetcher behind it. In the e2e channel it
// refuses outright: that harness runs beside the user's game with a throwaway userData and
// would re-download the whole model every run.
//
// VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (AGENTS.md trust boundary), unchanged from wave 1: every argument
// is a renderer value and is checked here, not trusted because today's only caller is the
// app's own UI. `speech:say`'s text becomes part of a cache key and hence a file name.
