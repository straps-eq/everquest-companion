// Three window populations live here because they share ONE security posture and are
// entangled at teardown (closing the main window destroys the rest):
//
//   - the main app window (frameless, bounds persisted),
//   - the floating overlays (one per OverlayKind, transparent + always-on-top), and
//   - the cursor ring (one transparent click-through window tracking the EQ window).
//
// The module owns their handles. Nothing outside reaches for a BrowserWindow: callers
// push to the renderer through `sendToMain` / `getOverlayWindow`, which keeps the
// null-when-closed lifetime in exactly one place.
//
// `src/main/security.ts` is the PURE half of the trust boundary (URL/pack-id predicates,
// no Electron, pinned by tests/security.test.mts). This file is the half that has to talk
// to Electron: the shared webPreferences object and the per-webContents / per-session
// hardening that installs those predicates.

// Electron default — a default is a decision someone else can change in a major bump, and
// `npm audit`-style reviews read this object, not Electron's changelog.
//
// WHY `sandbox: false` — MEASURED, not assumed. The two preloads are built by electron-vite
// from a two-entry rollup input (src/preload/{index,overlay}.ts) and both import the shared
// `src/shared/ipc.ts` channel registry, so rollup hoists it into
// `out/preload/chunks/ipc-<hash>.js` and each preload begins `require("./chunks/ipc-….js")`.
// A SANDBOXED preload's `require` is NOT Node's: it resolves `electron` plus a small
// polyfilled set (events/timers/url) and nothing else. Flipping this to `true` and running
// `npm run test:e2e` fails exactly there — the harness times out with no UI, and the e2e
// errors.log carries:
//
//   [main:preload-error] module not found: ./chunks/ipc-D4DrnWdv.js
//       at preloadRequire (node:electron/js2c/sandbox_bundle)
//
// i.e. `window.eq` is never installed and the app is silently dead. Nothing in the preloads
// themselves needs Node (they use exactly `contextBridge` + `ipcRenderer` — zero `process`,
// zero `fs`; `grep -c 'process\.' out/preload/index.js` is 0), so this is a PACKAGING blocker,
// not a design one: `sandbox: true` becomes available the moment each preload is emitted as
// ONE self-contained file. That is an electron.vite.config.ts change (a per-entry preload
// build, since rollup will always hoist a module shared by two entries into a chunk), owned
// outside this pass and written up as the top recommendation of the security report.
// `app.enableSandbox()` is blocked by the same finding, for the same reason.
//
// Until then the mitigations that actually matter without the OS sandbox are all on:
// contextIsolation (the preload's Node-capable context is unreachable from page JS), no
// nodeIntegration in any form, a deny-by-default navigation/window-open/webview policy
// (hardenWebContents), permissions denied wholesale (hardenSession), and a CSP with no
// script-src escape hatch in either page.

 *   2. `setWindowOpenHandler` — `window.open` / `<a target="_blank">` never opens an Electron
 *      window. An ALLOWLISTED https URL is handed to the user's default browser; anything
 *      else is dropped on the floor and logged. This is the door that matters most: the URLs
 *      reaching it are built from wiki page titles (see security.ts), and an unvalidated
 *      `shell.openExternal` would let one of them ask the OS to run `file:///…exe`.
 *   3. `will-attach-webview` — `<webview>` is disabled in webPreferences; this is the belt
 *      to that suspenders (and it strips node integration from the attach params first, so
 *      even a future deliberate webview can't be created Node-enabled by page markup).

// setIgnoreMouseEvents(forward) covers it.

//   - 'fight'   : current-fight meter + FIGHT selector.
//   - 'overall' : zone meter + ZONE-session selector.
//   - 'events'  : the live event log (alerts / notable loot / quest completions).
// All can be open simultaneously. The overlay renderer reads its kind from the ?kind= query on
// its URL so a single overlay.html bundle serves every window.
//
// Two interaction modes per window, persisted in that kind's `locked`:
//   - interactive: normal focusable window, -webkit-app-region drag on the header, resize
//     edges, close/config controls + selector + drill-down visible.
//   - locked (click-through): mouse events pass through to the game via
//     setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true}); the renderer's hover sensor toggles capture
//     back on so the hover-revealed pin stays clickable. Never steals focus. No drilling.

/**
 * Set a kind's click-through state. ONE definition, used by the lock toggle below and by the
 * renderer's fine-grained `overlay:setIgnoreMouse` — two call sites disagreeing about
 * `forward` would be a performance bug nobody could see.
 *
 * WHY `forward` IS PER-KIND. On Windows, `forward:true` installs a low-level mouse hook
 * (WH_MOUSE_LL) owned by the MAIN process: every system mouse event then waits on our message
 * loop, so a blocked main freezes the user's cursor system-wide (measured — it is why the
 * cursor ring deliberately does NOT forward). The METERS pay that cost for a reason: their
 * hover sensor is what re-enables capture over the pin button, and it only ever sees a
 * mouse-move if we forward one. The TOAST has no hover sensor — its capture is driven by its
 * QUEUE (a card is on screen, or it is not), which it learns over IPC — so it would pay the
 * hook for a window that is empty and idle almost all of the time. It does not forward.
 *
 * ...AND NOBODY FORWARDS DURING A HISTORICAL REPLAY (JOS-62). "Does this kind forward" is
 * answered by `overlayMouseForward` (replayGate.ts), which folds both rules into ONE place: for
 * the seconds the fold owns the message loop, the hook the meters normally pay for would land
 * squarely on the user's own mouselook — and the window it exists to serve is hidden anyway.
 * Click-through itself is unchanged; only its implementation gets cheaper.

 *
 * So an opaque toast window is SHOWN ONLY WHEN IT HAS SOMETHING TO SHOW, and this function reads

 * : false` — i.e. it asks to be ignored in exactly the states where it is drawing nothing, and to
 * capture the moment a card is on screen or the user is positioning it unlocked. One signal, one

// persisted `open:true` is untouched, so the TitleBar menu keeps telling the truth and a
// re-show is instant. Closing and re-creating them would churn five windows on every alt-tab,
// lose the mini drill-down, and (via the 'closed' handler) silently rewrite the user's
// open-state on a transition they never asked about.
//
// Only OPEN overlays are affected — this is a visibility filter layered over the open-state,
// never a second opinion about it.

/**
 * Show or hide every open overlay window.
 *
 * `showInactive`, not `show`: the same reason the first open uses it. An overlay must never
 * steal focus from the game, and coming back from auto-hide is exactly the moment it would —
 * the user just alt-tabbed INTO EverQuest, and a window that grabs focus on the way would undo
 * the thing that triggered it. Always-on-top and the locked/click-through mode are re-asserted
 * on the way back, because a hidden window can lose both on Windows.
 *
 * E2E never shows a window (src/main/e2e.ts is the whole test mode), so a re-show is skipped
 * there; hiding stays live, since hiding an already-hidden window is a no-op. A historical replay
 * (replayGate.ts) suppresses the re-show for the same seconds and by the same predicate — and
 * this function is ALSO the restore path afterwards, which is why the re-show re-asserts the
 * locked mode from the persisted config rather than remembering anything of its own.

//   * `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})` — every click passes straight through to the
//     game. Unlike the overlays there is NO hover sensor and no interactive mode: this window
//     has nothing to click, so pass-through is unconditional and permanent.
//   * NO `-webkit-app-region` anywhere in its page — it is not draggable, and cannot become a
