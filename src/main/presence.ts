// ============================================================================
// presence.ts — the WATCHER: one long-running child, and the state it maintains.
// ============================================================================
//
// Two features need the same four facts — is EQ running, is EQ the foreground window, where is
// that window, and is the system cursor being drawn — so they are answered ONCE, here:
//
//   * overlay AUTO-HIDE (hide the floating meters when the game isn't running / isn't focused)
//   * the CURSOR RING (a halo drawn only over the EQ window, only while it is focused)
//
// THE COST MODEL IS THE DESIGN. Windows has no cross-process "foreground window changed" event
// an Electron main process can subscribe to without native code, so somebody has to poll. The
// naive shape — `exec('powershell …')` on a timer — spawns a PROCESS per sample, and a
// PowerShell cold start is ~100 ms of CPU. At any useful cadence that is a permanent tax on a
// machine that is also running a game.
//
// So: ONE long-running child. It is spawned lazily (only when a feature that needs it is
// switched on — see `presenceNeeded` in shared/presencePrefs.ts), it polls in-process at
// ~150 ms, and it prints a line ONLY when something CHANGES. Steady state is a sleeping process
// and an idle pipe — near-zero CPU on both sides, and Node does no work at all between
// transitions. It is killed the moment the last consumer goes away. Never spawned in e2e
// (`EQ_E2E=1`) or off Windows.
//
// THE PURE HALF — the stdout line protocol, the EQ-window predicate, the alt-tab debounce and
// the gating matrix — lives in `presenceProtocol.ts` (the security.ts ↔ windows.ts split), which
// is what `tests/presence.test.mts` drives with no Electron in sight. `presenceEffects.ts` is
// what ACTS on any of it; this file only knows facts.

/**
 * The polling loop, as PowerShell. Sent to `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand` (base64 UTF-16LE)
 * rather than through a shell or stdin: no quoting rules apply to base64, so the script below
 * is the script that runs, byte for byte.
 *
 * Everything expensive happens once, before the loop: the P/Invoke surface is compiled by
 * `Add-Type` at startup (~1 s, paid a single time per app run) and process image paths are
 * memoized per pid. The loop itself is five user32 calls and a string compare.
 *
 * CURSOR VISIBILITY is one of those calls. `GetCursorInfo` reports the session-wide cursor, and
 * EverQuest hides it for the whole time the right button is held (mouselook) — during which it
 * also re-centers the pointer every frame, so an absolute cursor sample oscillates while nothing
 * is on screen to follow it. `CURSORINFO.flags` is a bit field, so the test is
 * `& CURSOR_SHOWING(0x1)`, not `!= 0`. A failed call answers "showing": the ring is a display
 * aid, and a watcher that cannot see the cursor must not be the reason it disappears.
 *
 * `$ErrorActionPreference` drops to SilentlyContinue after `Add-Type`, ON PURPOSE: reading
 * `.Path` on a protected process raises a non-terminating error every 5 s forever, and the
 * watcher's job is to answer best-effort, not to be right about processes it may not inspect.
 *
 * THE RUNNING POLL IS NAME-FIRST, PATH-SECOND — measured, not stylistic. `ProcessName` is
 * already in the snapshot `GetProcesses()` returns, while `MainModule.FileName` OPENS the
 * process and THROWS for every protected one; interleaving them meant a few hundred .NET
 * exceptions per poll on a normal desktop. Two separate passes make the common case (the game
 * is running, under its own name) cost one string compare per process, and the path scan — the
 * fallback for a client installed under a different exe name — runs only when the cheap pass
 * found nothing.
