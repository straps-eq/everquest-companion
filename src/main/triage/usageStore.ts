// usageStore — the usage-analytics half of the triage store (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md §4).
//
// Split from store.ts when two independent waves (the A2/A3 readout and the smoke test's
// per-id reader) composed that file past the 400-line ceiling — the merge crossed the cap
// even though each wave alone stayed under it, which is exactly the failure mode a per-file
// cap is supposed to surface. Same laws as store.ts: every read is a single bounded
// statement; consumers import these names FROM store.ts (it re-exports this whole module),
// so the split moved code, not import paths.
//
// THREE READS, and each is a single indexed statement with a bound:
//   * `usage_daily` and `usage_funnel_daily` are `day >= :floor` over the PRIMARY KEY's
//     leading column, so the window bounds the scan.
//   * `analytics_install` is the whole table, because that is the question — WAU/MAU,
//     retention cohorts and version spread are all "count rows by a date", and there is no
//     window that makes them cheaper. It is bounded by a LIMIT anyway: this panel must not
//     promise to render an install base it has not measured.
//
// THE TABLES MAY NOT EXIST. A stack applied before the A2 migration answers `42P01
// undefined_table`, which is a genuinely different fact from "the tables are empty" and the
// panel renders it differently (available:false vs honest zeros). `missingTable` is how the
// caller tells them apart without matching on message text.
//
// NEITHER MAY THE `cohort` COLUMN. A stack migrated from a schema.sql that predates the
// user/owner split answers `42703 undefined_column` instead, which is the SAME class of fact —
// "this cluster has not been migrated to what this code reads" — and gets the same treatment
// rather than a stack trace in a panel. `missingColumn` is its `missingTable`.
//
// EVERY COHORT IS READ, ALWAYS, AND THE SPLIT HAPPENS IN JS. There is no `WHERE cohort = …`
// here on purpose: the default readout is the user cohort, but the caller ALSO has to know
// whether any owner rows exist at all (that is what makes the tab's toggle honest instead of a
// mystery switch), and `--cohort all` needs both anyway. One statement answers all three
// questions; a cohort predicate would have made it two or three.
