//
// PURE, and that is the whole point of the file. Every number the Analytics tab shows is
// computed here from three arrays of plain rows, so `tests/usageAnalytics.test.mts` can author
// a population by hand and assert the arithmetic — no cluster, no credentials, no fixtures.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE OBEYS, and it is world-model law 1 wearing a different hat: CLAIM ONLY
// WHAT THE TABLES CAN ANSWER. `src/shared/telemetryRollup.ts`'s header enumerates what daily
// anonymous counters structurally cannot say; the shapes in `src/shared/triage.ts` were cut to
// fit that, and the places where the plan asked for something un-derivable are labelled rather
// than approximated:
//
//   * per-feature REACH becomes uses + uses-per-session;
//   * MEDIAN session length is a bucket RANGE;
//   * RETENTION is survival ("first seen on D, still seen on or after D+N"), because no
//     per-day-per-id row exists to answer "came back exactly on D+N".
//
// EMPTY IS A REAL ANSWER. Every section below returns zeros and empty lists for an empty
// window rather than throwing or short-circuiting, so the panel can render honest zeros and
// say "no data yet" — a state that is genuinely different from "the tables do not exist".
