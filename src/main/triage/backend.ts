// ============================================================================
// backend.ts — the TriageBackend seam, and its one AWS-touching implementation.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY AN INTERFACE AT ALL. `store.ts` is a set of free functions over a `Clients` value it
// builds itself from a Terraform output file and an AWS profile; it offers no injection point,
// so an IPC handler written directly against it can only be exercised with real credentials
// against the real cluster. The interface below is the injection point: `ipc.ts` names only
// `TriageBackend`, and `awsBackend()` is a thin pass-through whose entire job is to turn rows
// into the shapes in `src/shared/triage.ts` (all of which live in `rows.ts`, pure and tested).
//
// LAZY, AND ONE CONNECTION. `makeClients` opens the postgres socket on the FIRST statement,
// so merely having the triage tab compiled in costs nothing until the user opens it. The
// client is held for the process lifetime — a live DSQL connection is what makes the second
// query fast, and `close()` exists for the app's own teardown.
//
// CREDENTIALS COME FROM THE LAUNCHING SHELL: `AWS_PROFILE`, defaulting to `eqc` — the same
// profile name the CLI is documented with in AGENTS.md. Possession of those credentials IS
// the access control (see the header of store.ts); a different shell gets IAM denials, which
// arrive here as ordinary errors and are rendered as prose.

/**
 * THE THREE OUTCOMES THIS DISTINGUISHES, because the panel renders them completely differently

 *
 *   * `42P01 undefined_table` (the A2 migration has not run here) or `42703 undefined_column`
 *     (it ran, but before the user/owner split added `cohort`). Both are "this cluster is not
 *     migrated to what this code reads": `state: 'missing'`, naming the missing thing, which
 *     is a fact an operator can act on in one command.
 *   * THE CLUSTER STOPPED ANSWERING mid-read — `state: 'unreachable'`. It used to be neither
 *     of these: the panel printed node-postgres’s own `Connection terminated unexpectedly`,
 *     and the ASYNC half of the same failure was an uncaughtException in the main process
 *     (store.ts `connect` now listens for it). It is a separate named state because it asks a
 *     different thing of the operator than a missing table does: nothing. Retry.
 *   * EVERY OTHER OUTCOME, including three empty result sets — the tables exist and are empty
 *     (the state of a lit client whose server-side `telemetry_accepting` is still closed, or
 *     simply a quiet day). That is honest zeros plus "no data yet", not a "not built" banner.
 *
 * Anything unclassified (an IAM denial, a permission error) is still THROWN and reaches the
 * panel as prose through `attempt()`. A degrade that swallowed everything would hide the next
 * real failure behind a reassuring banner.
 *
 * ONE READ, TWO READOUTS. The statements fetch every cohort; the split is the three `ofCohort`
 * calls below. `buildAnalytics` runs once per cohort over its own rows, so the owner’s sessions
 * are never a denominator for a user-cohort rate.
