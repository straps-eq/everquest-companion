/**
 * store.ts — the I/O half of triage: Aurora DSQL + S3, directly over IAM.
 *
 * RELOCATED from `scripts/triageStore.mts` (unchanged in substance) so that the SAME code
 * backs both readers: the `triage-feedback` CLI, which still imports it, and the dev-only
 * triage tab in the app. There is exactly one implementation of "read the backlog", and the
 * two front ends cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ===========================================================================================
 * WHO CAN USE THIS: whoever holds the owner's AWS credentials. Nobody else. That is the whole
 * access-control story and it is deliberate.
 *
 *   * NO PASSWORD EXISTS. DSQL authenticates with a short-lived IAM token that
 *     `@aws-sdk/dsql-signer` derives LOCALLY from whatever credentials the process is running
 *     under — read from the launching shell's `AWS_PROFILE` (default `eqc`), exactly like the
 *     CLI. Nothing is stored in the app, nothing is rotated, nothing can be copied out of a
 *     config file — the same reason the ingest Lambda needs no secret.
 *   * A build shipped to a user has no credentials, so every statement here would fail at the
 *     IAM boundary. It also has no `@aws-sdk/*` to load in the first place: those are
 *     devDependencies, which electron-builder never packages. The dev-flag guard in
 *     `src/main/index.ts` is the third, outermost lock, not the only one.
 *   * The CLI connects as `admin` (IAM action `dsql:DbConnectAdmin`, granted to the triage
 *     role in iam.tf) because it is the operator identity: it applies the schema and it is the
 *     deletion path for `forget` and `wipe`.
 * ===========================================================================================
 *
 * THERE IS NO SERVER-SIDE READ API (D4). The dev machine has an AWS profile; this module opens
 * a postgres connection to the DSQL cluster and talks to S3 with the SDK. Building a public,
 * authenticated read endpoint would be a second thing to secure for zero benefit.
 *
 * POLITENESS, the same discipline AGENTS.md's scraper law asks of every fetcher in this repo,
 * applied to a paid API instead of someone else's server:
 *   * CACHE FIRST — `terraform output -json` is shelled out ONCE and cached in
 *     .triage/stack.json; a downloaded slice is written to .triage/slices/ and a second read
 *     never re-downloads it. Re-runs are free, and the app shares the CLI's cache.
 *   * ONE ROUND TRIP — every read is a single indexed statement with a LIMIT.
 *   * BACK OFF — DSQL is optimistic: a write that raced is aborted at commit with SQLSTATE
 *     40001 and must be retried, not hammered. `withRetry` is bounded and jittered.
 *   * IDEMPOTENT — every mutation is keyed by primary key; re-running a command converges
 *     instead of duplicating.
 *
 * PHYSICAL NAMES ARE NEVER COMMITTED. Everything comes from the Terraform outputs at run time;
 * .triage/ is gitignored.

/**
 * Download + gunzip a slice to .triage/slices/<reportId>.log, RE-SCRUBBED ON READ.
 *
 * `rescrubSlice` (./rows.ts, pure and tested without AWS) is the third leg of "nothing a client
 * sends is trusted": the presign policy pins an upload's key, size and content-type and CANNOT
 * pin its content, so what landed in the bucket is only as scrubbed as the uploader chose to
 * be. The downloaded bytes go through the app's own shared scrubber and text sanitizer BEFORE
 * they touch the owner's disk, and what that removed is reported back to the caller.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL S3 OBJECT IS NOT TOUCHED. It is the evidence; `forget` is the only thing that
 * deletes it. What is re-scrubbed is the owner's local copy.
 *
 * CACHED: a second call re-reads the sidecar rather than S3. The file is gitignored twice over
 * (`.triage/` and the blanket `*.log`) and its contents never reach a public issue.
