// telemetry/collector.ts — accept an event, put it in the ring, and own the analyticsId.
//
// Everything that WRITES to the ring goes through `recordEvent`, and `recordEvent` refuses when
// the user's switch is off. That is one gate, in one place, rather than a check at each of the
// (eventually many) call sites — the same reasoning that put `queueFlushEnabled` inside
// `startQueueFlush` instead of restating it in the composition root.
//
// THE analyticsId (plan T3). A separate, anonymous, ROTATABLE id — deliberately NOT the
// feedback `installId`, so the two data sets cannot be joined even by us. It is minted LAZILY on
// the collector's first start, never at migration time: a store migration that minted an
// identifier would create one for a user who then turns the feature off before it is ever used.
// Rotation mints a new one AND drops the ring, which by design severs the retention chain — a
// rotated id is a new cohort member, and TELEMETRY.md says so.
