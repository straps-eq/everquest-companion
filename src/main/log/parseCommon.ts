// Shared vocabulary for the parse cascade (see parser.ts).
//
// The single parse pass is a CASCADE of per-family classifiers whose ORDER IS SEMANTIC
// (e.g. the resist family must test the possessive-YOUR form before the named-caster form
// because 712 spell names contain `'s`). Each classifier is a pure
// `(ClassifyCtx) => LogEvent | null`; parser.ts holds the one ordered list and runs it.
// This module carries the pieces every family needs: the context envelope and the
// name-normalization helpers (moved here verbatim from combat/parse.ts by way of parser.ts).

 * word-bounded. VERIFIED SAFE against the real log (2026-08-01): NO fade/fizzle/
 * interrupt line ever ends in a Roman numeral, and every one of the 16 distinct
 * rank-tailed base spells (Swift Like the Wind, Shiftless Deeds, Allure, Clarity,
 * Superior Healing, Lay on Hands, …) is a real spell whose identity does not include a

 * owner's log the sweep alone asks it tens of millions of times, and it was 1.8% of the whole

 *
 * The domain is the set of SPELL AND SKILL NAMES a log prints, which is closed and small (the
