//   "<healer> healed <target> for 85 (107) hit points by <Spell>."    (actual first,

// `amount` is always the FIRST number (effective heal); the parenthesized raw amount
// is captured separately as `rawAmount`. Singular "hit point" is tolerated too.
//
// CRITICAL HEALS (Task #59): heal lines carry the damage family's trailing paren modifier —
// "… by Superior Healing. (Critical)" — AFTER the sentence period, so the old `\.$` anchor
// REJECTED all 233 of them and the model silently lost those heals (nine distinct spells,

// (Slugs Healing 191, Ethereal Cleansing 131, Echoing Light 78, …), 117 of them the player's
// own. The ` over time` sits between the target and the `for`, so the lazy target capture
// SWALLOWED it and every HoT tick was attributed to a phantom entity called
// "Primitive over time". It is now captured as its own optional group: the target is the real
// name again, and `overTime` reaches the model, where the cast-less proc detector needs it (a
// HoT tick is cast-DETACHED exactly the way a DoT tick is — see procDetect's DoT gate).

// Three VERIFIED self-form families (see MitigationEvent in shared/logEvents.ts for the counts):

//   `<mob> tries to bash YOU, but YOUR magical skin absorbs the blow!`   → 'absorbSwing' (COUNT)
//        …but as of the MISS_RE self-absorb fix this shape is claimed by the MISS family
//        instead (miss, mtype 'absorb', target 'You'); see the note below RUNE_GAIN_RE.
//   `YOUR magical skin absorbs the damage of <mob>'s thorns.`            → 'absorbDamageShield'
// The blow form is matched ONLY AFTER MISS_RE has been given the line (see classify). That fix
// HAS NOW LANDED: MISS_RE learned the bare-`YOUR` alternative, so every real absorbed swing is a
// `miss` event with mtype 'absorb' and target 'You', and this branch no longer fires for any shape
// present in the log. It is kept as the safety net for the one shape MISS_RE still declines — a
// COMPOUND trailing modifier (`! (Riposte Slay Undead)`), which MISS_RE's single-word
// `\([A-Za-z]+\)` tail rejects while this regex's `[A-Za-z ]+` accepts. No such line exists today
// (full-log sweep 2026-08-02: the miss family's only modifiers are the single words Riposte 4751,
// Rampage 92, Flurry 65 — compound modifiers appear on DAMAGE lines only). Either way a line yields
// EXACTLY ONE event, so the engine (which counts absorbed swings off both the mitigation path and
// incoming misses with mtype 'absorb') can never double-count.

//   miss!/misses!                        → 'miss' (self uses base, 3rd person -es)
//   <defender> parries/dodges/ripostes/blocks!   → defender-named, 3rd person verb
//   YOU parry/dodge/riposte/block!               → defender = you, base verb
//   <name>'s magical skin absorbs the blow!      → 'absorb', defender = <name>
//   YOUR magical skin absorbs the blow!          → 'absorb', defender = You
// An optional trailing swing modifier " (Riposte)"/"(Flurry)"/"(Rampage)" may
// follow the "!" — allowed and discarded.
//
// SELF RUNE ABSORB (bug fix, verified against the real log 2026-08-02): the absorb
// alternative used to require a POSSESSIVE `<name>'s magical skin`, so the SELF form —
// `A deadly black widow tries to bite YOU, but YOUR magical skin absorbs the blow!` —
// never produced a MISS event. (It fell through to 'unknown' originally; Task #59 then
// caught it downstream as a `mitigation` event, which fixed the absorption COUNT but left
// the miss aggregate just as blind, since a mitigation event never reaches routeMiss.)
// Full-log sweep: 385 bare-`YOUR` lines vs 1,428 possessive lines that parsed fine. Every
// dropped line is an INCOMING avoided swing, so the loss was a pure undercount in the
// engine's incoming miss aggregates (addIncMiss) and therefore in defensive hit% /
// avoidance — no damage total moved (a miss carries no amount, law 8).
// The two absorb shapes are DISJOINT (`.+?'s ` needs a literal apostrophe-s that the
// `YOUR` form does not have), so the added alternative can never steal a possessive line.
// The self branch names NO defender — group 2 is the swing's object — so it supplies one
// itself: YOUR skin means the swing was at YOU (see classify()). Observed shapes are all
// third-person `<mob> tries to <verb> YOU, …`, with `(Riposte)` the only modifier (34×).
//
// PREPOSITIONAL VERBS (Task #58): a few melee verbs take an object preposition —
// "You try to frenzy ON a deadly black widow, but miss!" — and the bare `\w+ (.+?)`
// capture swallowed it, so the miss carried the target "on a deadly black widow"
// while the LANDED form ("You frenzy on X for N points…") parsed clean. That leaked a
// phantom "on <mob>" defender into every per-mob view. The optional `(?:on )?` is
// greedy, so it is consumed whenever present and skipped otherwise.
// VERIFIED against the real log (full sweep, 2026-08-02): of the 26 distinct verbs in the
// "tr(y|ies) to <verb>" family, `frenzy` is the ONLY one that takes a preposition
// (1,012 lines, all "on"); no other verb is ever followed by on/at/with/upon/into, and no
// mob name begins with the word "on", so the strip cannot eat part of a real name.

//   "<target> resisted <caster>'s <Spell>!"    → a named caster (pet or mob)
//   "You resist[ed] <caster>'s <Spell>!"       → INCOMING, you resisted a mob's spell

/**
 * The lane name a melee VERB damages under. Exported so an avoided swing can be laned the same
 * way a landed one is (`routeMiss` → the round grouper's lane label): one derivation, so a miss
 * can never disagree with the hit it accompanied about what skill was swung.
 *
 * THE RULE IS "A NAMED CLASS SKILL, NOT A WEAPON SWING". `slash`/`pierce`/`crush`/`hit` and the
 * rest are what a weapon in a hand prints, and four of them are one auto-attack lane — so they
 * share the generic name and the Rounds panel splits them by verb instead. A verb that names an
 * ABILITY the class list grants gets its own row, because a player who pressed a button wants to
 * see what it did. Each entry below is evidence-verified against `src/main/data/classes.json`'s
 * skill→class table (Backstab ROG, Bash PAL/SHD/WAR, Kick BST/MNK/RNG/WAR, Frenzy BER,
 * Cleave WAR, Smite PAL) — never a matcher over verb spelling, which would happily promote
 * `slice`.
 *
 * CLEAVE (JOS-77, user report 01KZCZ3BYRQRD4JQJ0PW7FQRG5 — "the combat parser does not appear
 * to capture cleave, or at a minimum it's not split out like Frenzy, Bash and Kick are"). The
 * damage was never missing: `cleave` has been in MELEE_VERBS since the missing-verbs fix, and
 * the reporter's own 30-minute slice folds all 171 of his cleave hits into the generic lane.
 * The ROW could not exist — the same shape as the Dragon Punch report, one lane over.
 * MEASURED, and this is what makes it a skill rather than a damage tier of some weapon verb:
 * `Cleave` is WAR-only at level 5 in the class table, and the owner's own 1.4M-line log — 71k
 * `You slash` lines up to 2,100 damage, 11k `You crush` — contains ZERO self cleaves, while it
 * carries 20,334 INCOMING ones from mobs. A verb that never once prints for a player who lacks
 * the skill, however hard he swings, is gated on the skill and not on the damage.
 *
 * SMITE (JOS-81 — cleave's twin, closing the gap this comment used to describe). `Smite` is a
 * PAL-only innate at level 9 in the class table, and the owner IS a paladin, so unlike cleave
 * the evidence is his own swings: 13,984 `You smite` lines and 1,223 third-person ones (all of
 * them other players' — Lizgar and friends), every one of them reading "Melee" until now.
 * WHAT PROVES IT IS A SKILL AND NOT A WEAPON VERB is the skill-up stream, and it is decisive:
 * `You have become better at Smite!` ticks 280 times, whereas a weapon verb NEVER ticks under
 * its own name — a slash ticks `1H Slashing`, a crush `1H Blunt`, a pierce `1H Piercing`, a
 * punch `Hand to Hand` (whole-log enumeration of all 56 skill-up names, 2026-08-06). Smite ticks
 * beside Kick, Bash, Backstab and Frenzy, which is exactly the company this table keeps.
 *
 * THE SKILL LANE AND THE SPELL LANE SHARE A STEM AND MUST NEVER MERGE. `Smiting Strike` is the
 * paladin's proc — `You hit <mob> for 259 points of magic damage by Smiting Strike.`, 15,016
 * lines — and it is a SPELL: it comes in on the `by <Spell>` path, carries no melee verb at all
 * (`verb` is undefined by construction), lands in the `spell` category and has always had its
 * own named row. This function never sees it. The two are one second apart in the log and one
 * letter apart in the eye; "Smite" is the melee verb only.
