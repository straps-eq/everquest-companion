//         (`Shiftless Deeds III`, `Allure VI`) because the same line fires when two SPELL
//         SCROLLS are merged. A rank is not a tier, so `tier` stays undefined there.
//     4×  `Your request to merge <target> with <component> failed. The items do not match,
//         are the exact same item, cannot be merged, the component (the item to be
//         destroyed) has an augment, or one of the items is no longer in your inventory.`
//         The ONLY failure shape that names items — and `<target>` carries its ` +N`, i.e.
//         it states the tier of an item you are holding.
//     9×  `The item you are trying to add will not work, this mote is not sufficiently
//         powerful to upgrade this item.`                            (no item named)
//     4×  `The item you are trying to add will not work, you cannot fuse an item to
//         itself.` — NB this one never says "merge", so a sweep on that word alone MISSES
//         it; it surfaced by diffing parsed output against the raw log. (no item named)

//         types of items.`                                           (no item named)

//         pickup. ALREADY parsed by the loot family as disposition:'combined' + `created`
//         (every one of the 302 creates `<same base> +N`), so a second matcher would

//         host it is socketed into, and carries no tier, so it can neither identify the
//         item in front of you nor advance any tier state.
//    ~30× `You successfully destroyed 1 <Item> +N.` — the item is GONE; a destroy can only
//         retire tier evidence we never claimed to be current inventory.
//   Motes appear ONLY inside ordinary loot lines (`--You have looted a Mote of
//   Infinitesimal Potential …--`), which the loot family already parses.
