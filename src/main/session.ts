 *     windows come back in their CONFIGURED state, which for an auto-hide user whose game is not
 *     focused is still "hidden" — never a flash of five overlays.
 *
 * Nothing here remembers a lock state: `setOverlaysHidden` re-applies each overlay's mode from

  // first bytes — so a line can be folded neither twice nor never. That property is a fact about
  // byte offsets, not about timing, which is what makes the replay safe to slice cooperatively:
  // the fold now yields to the event loop every REPLAY_SLICE_MS instead of every 1 MB read chunk,
  // and a longer wall clock simply leaves more bytes waiting for the tailer.

  // back is a claim, not a measurement.

  // THE REPLAY IS A STATE, AND THE REGISTRY IS TOLD SO (JOS-60). Modules fold replay events

  // pending delta, and anything that flushed mid-replay (the heartbeat above, the `flushNow()`
