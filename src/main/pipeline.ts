// pipeline.ts — the log-derived world: one event stream, and everything that folds it.
// ============================================================================
//
// See AGENTS.md → Architecture. Both feeders (the startup scan and the live Tailer) push
// onto ONE LogBus; the ModuleRegistry folds every event into each extension module and the
// CombatEngine folds it into its own state machine.
//
// This module CONSTRUCTS that world and wires it, at import time, in the order the design
// requires — the module instances (via `modules/wiring.ts`, which owns the list and its order),
// the registry host that pushes `module:delta`, and the two bus subscriptions. index.ts imports
// it as the composition root's first act; `session.ts` drives it (scan → tail → reset on
// character switch).
//
// The module ORDER is load-bearing and is documented in modules/wiring.ts, beside the
// constructions. Do not reorder them. That file is Electron-free on purpose: `npm run bench:replay`
// folds the same modules in the same order OUTSIDE Electron to attribute the startup fold per
// consumer (JOS-55), and it must not be holding a private copy of the list.

// you with and knows what you are wearing; it does NOT know which stances this character can

//
// The loadout is a PULL, read at the instant of each evaluation, for the reason ipc/stanceAdvice.ts
// states: the combo module re-derives its intervals whenever evidence lands (a single `/who` row
// re-labels the past hour), so a copy taken at wiring time describes a character we had not
// finished identifying. It reads `currentInterval()` rather than `snapshot()` deliberately — a
// snapshot re-baselines that module's delta bookkeeping, and a consumer that merely LOOKS must
// not silently swallow a delta the renderer was owed.
//
// The emission is `emitDerived`, the same door buffs/epoch/offlineGap use: the event is QUEUED
// and delivered after the primary damage event has finished reaching every listener, so nothing
// re-enters the fold. No feedback loop is possible — the advisor only ever fires from an incoming
// `damage` event, and a `stanceMismatch` is not one.

// only — the historical scan (live:false) would otherwise fire thousands of lookups; the
// cache/local-posky path covers those instantly on demand.
//
// Task #59 folded this INTO the event-feed module: its live-loot notability probe calls the
// same cache-first `lookupItem`, so the cache is warmed exactly as before with ONE request
// per item (the module also de-dupes concurrent probes of the same name, which the bare
// prefetch did not). A second subscription here would double-request every uncached loot.
//
// The THIRD and last subscription — epoch detection — is added by index.ts, after this
// module has finished wiring: it must observe each event only once the modules and the
// combat engine have folded it, and it reaches for the active character, which session.ts
// owns. See the composition root.
