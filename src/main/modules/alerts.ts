// alerts module — the first real proof of the EqModule extension contract.
//
// It evaluates 'event' and 'raw' alert triggers against LIVE LogEvents only (the
// registry never flushes during replay, but we ALSO gate here so a future direct
// caller can't accidentally fire on historical events), respecting each alert's
// enabled flag and cooldown. Each fire is accumulated and pushed as the standard
// `module:delta` payload `{ fired: FiredAlert[] }`; the renderer's always-mounted
// player turns those into actual audio.
//
// 'app'-type triggers (e.g. bossDefeat) are evaluated RENDERER-side (they depend
// on derived boss state that lives in the renderer), so this module stores/serves
// their defs via snapshot() but never fires them itself.
//
// COMPOSITE triggers (Task #47): a trigger may be `{type:'any'|'all', conditions:[…]}` over
// the primitive event/raw/app shapes. 'any' fires when ANY condition matches a single event
// (OR); 'all' fires only when EVERY condition matches THE SAME event (AND — same-event only,
// no cross-event windows). Cooldown is per ALERT, not per condition — and, since the owner's
// 2026-08-04 slow incident, per alert-and-TARGET when the def asks for it (`cooldownScope`,
// see `cooldownKey` below). It also matches the DERIVED
// `buffExpired` event the buffs module synthesizes (a resolved, unambiguous "wears off you /
// your pet" signal) — see shared/logEvents.ts BuffExpiredEvent + log/bus.ts emitDerived.
//
// A DERIVED EVENT NEEDS NOTHING FROM THIS FILE, and the second one proves it. `stanceMismatch`
// (main/combat/stanceAdvisor.ts) is the first event in the app that NO log line produces — a
// join over a mob's measured damage profile, the wiki's stance multipliers and the stance worn
// right now. It arrives on the same bus through the same `emitDerived` queue and is matched by
// the same string compare on `kind`; its `target` field is the mob, so `cooldownScope:'target'`
// works on it for free, and it names no spell (the table below is unchanged). The one thing
// that IS different about it is where the throttling lives: the condition is continuously true
// for a whole fight rather than true for one line, so it is rate-limited at the SOURCE (once per
// mob/tier/recommendation per engagement) and the def's cooldown is only the last bound.
//
// Alert defs are owned by the store; the module holds a live copy that main keeps
// in sync (setDefs) whenever the user saves/deletes an alert.

/**
 * THE SPELL NAMES ONE EVENT CAN HONESTLY ANSWER TO (JOS-84) — `ev.spell` plus every name in the
 * event's `candidates` list, or an empty array when the event carries no candidates.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `buffApply.spell` / `buffWearOff.spell` are documented as a BEST-EFFORT PICK:
 * EQ's landing and wears-off sentences are shared across a whole spell family (`<mob> slows
 * down.` is Forlorn Deeds / Languid Pace / Rejuvenation / Shiftless Deeds / Tepid Deeds; `<mob>
 * looks frail.` is Disempower / Incapacitate / Listless Power), so the parser cannot name the
 * spell from the line and puts the FIRST DB candidate in `spell` while `candidates` carries the
 * truth. The suggestion wizard authored `where:{spell:'<your spell>'}` against that first pick,
 * which is a coin flip the user always loses: an enchanter's Shiftless Deeds alert was compared
 * to the string "Forlorn Deeds" and could never fire. MEASURED against the reporter's own log
 * lines — that is the whole of JOS-84.
 *
 * So a `where.spell` matcher tests the WHOLE SET. It is the same reading shared/alertGroups.ts
 * already argues for the on-you slow ("both sentences are shared by a whole slow family and name
 * no spell, so this alert reports that a slow expired, never which one"), applied to the mob side
 * as well: when the game prints one sentence for five spells, an alert on any one of them is an
 * alert on the family, and firing is the honest answer. The alternative — silence — is the bug.
 *
 * SCOPE. Only the `spell` key widens, and only when the event actually carries `candidates`.
 * `where:{candidates:…}` is untouched (it still sees `fieldText`'s '[object Object]' join, which
 * is what today's defs are matched against), families with no candidate list (castBegin, resist,
 * buffFade, the derived buffExpired) are byte-for-byte unchanged, and an event that carries
 * candidates but no `spell` field at all (poisonProc names its `strike`) still fails the
 * pre-existing "field is absent ⇒ no match" test before this is ever consulted.
