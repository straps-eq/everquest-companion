// INTERVAL CONSTRUCTION for the class-combo model (docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md § 4.5).
//
// PURE: observations + `/who` rows + level dings + user corrections in, ComboInterval[] out.
//
// A LOADOUT SWAP PRINTS NOTHING. `grep -ci loadout` over 1.1M lines returns 37 hits and every
// one is another player's chat. So every boundary here is INFERENCE, it is always a RANGE
// [startLo, startHi] rather than an instant, and the detectors are ranked by how much the log
// actually said:
//
//   who            two consecutive /who rows disagree. The game NAMED both loadouts; the swap
//                  is somewhere between the rows. Hard, and nothing overrides it.
//   levelDrop      a `Welcome to level N!` with N <= the previous ding. Displayed level is the
//                  MINIMUM of the loadout's class levels, so a non-increasing ding is a swap —
//                  note `<=`, not `<`: the real log has a genuine 11 → 11 REPEAT 0.9 h apart
//                  that a strict-descent predicate misses. (levelSeries.ts keeps `<` on
//                  purpose and is pinned by its own golden window — do not "fix" it.)
//   evidenceShift  a class with sustained exclusive evidence goes silent and a different one
//                  starts. This is what NARROWS a boundary: the Aug 2 swap is bracketed 33.9 h
//                  apart by level dings, and to ~60 min (last MNK Feign Death 00:57:55 → first
//                  ROG Backstab 01:57:42) by the shift. Both fire for the same swap; the
//                  narrower window wins and the other is recorded in `startAlso`.
//
// The one thing a `/who` row NEVER loses to is a narrower inferred window — hence the explicit
// precedence in `mergeBoundaries`.

/**
 * LEVEL DINGS THE MERGE SWALLOWED, PUT BACK WHEN THE EVIDENCE SAYS THEY WERE A SECOND SWAP.
 * This is the JOS-79 convergence fix, and it is worth stating exactly what went wrong.
 *
 * `levelDropBoundaries` dates a ding's swap as "somewhere between the previous ding and this
 * one" — and after a swap that previous ding is by construction in the PREVIOUS era, so the
 * window routinely reaches back across an earlier swap. `mergeBoundaries` then reads that
 * overlap as "these two detectors describe the same event", keeps the narrower one, and the
 * ding's CUT is gone. MEASURED on the live log (2026-08-06): the swap into a wizard loadout
 * dinged at Aug 06 19:31:23, and its window opened at the previous ding on Aug 04 20:57:35 —
 * 46.6 h earlier, swallowing the Aug 04 23:38:01 evidence shift that was itself a real swap.
 * One boundary came out where there were two, and the app spent the whole evening naming a
 * loadout the owner had stopped playing.
 *
 * The discriminator is the EVIDENCE, never the clock, and it is the same test an evidence shift
 * already has to pass: a class with sustained exclusive evidence GOES SILENT and a different one
 * STARTS. Applied across the ding:
 *
 *   Aug 02 (the swap CW2 pins): before = {BER,ROG}, after = {BER,ENC,PAL,ROG}. Nothing departs —
 *          the ding 19 minutes after the shift is that same swap, dated worse. Absorbed, as it
 *          has always been, and CW2's boundary is untouched.
 *   Aug 06: before = {ENC,MNK,PAL}, after = {ENC,PAL,WIZ}. MNK leaves, WIZ arrives. Two swaps.
 *
 * Requiring BOTH directions is what keeps it conservative: right after a ding everything looks
 * "departed" simply because no time has passed, so an arrival that clears the ≥2-bucket sustain
 * bar is what has to carry the claim. And because this only ever RE-ADDS a cut the merge had
 * already deleted, it cannot move a boundary the model gets right today.

 *   2. Otherwise the correction OVERLAPPING the slice most wins.
 *
 * Rule 2 exists because boundaries move under a standing override. A correction is written
 * against the interval the user was looking at (`startTs` = that interval's cut) and intervals
 * are rebuilt from scratch on every fold — `mergeBoundaries`/`reinstatedDrops`/`collapse` are
 * not monotone, so a cut that existed when the user pressed Save can be gone one event later.
 * When that happens the slice covering *now* begins BEFORE the correction, rule 1 misses, and
 * under the old code the override vanished with no UI event and inference silently reclaimed
 * the display — the exact failure the ticket is about. Greatest-overlap is the conservative
 * repair: it never displaces a covering correction, and where several merely overlap it picks
