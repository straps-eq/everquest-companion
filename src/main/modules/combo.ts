// combo module — which THREE classes was this character running, and when did that change?
// docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md § 5.1. The EqModule shell only; the thinking lives in
// three PURE siblings (comboEvidence / comboScore / comboIntervals) that take plain arrays,
// which is what lets tests/comboWindows.test.mts golden-window this without Electron.
//
// WHY THE FEATURE EXISTS AT ALL. EQ Legends runs up to three classes at once, the displayed
// level is the MINIMUM of their levels, and a loadout swap is NEVER logged — verified twice on
// full-log sweeps. The character's own `/who` row states the loadout outright and there are
// ELEVEN of them in 1.1M lines, none within 33 hours of the swap this log actually contains.
// So the app either infers the combo and labels it inferred, or it says nothing at all.
//
// REGISTERED FIRST in pipeline.ts: within one bus delivery every later module (and the combat
// engine) then sees an already-advanced combo state for the same event. It consumes no derived
// events and emits none, so the order change is purely additive.
//
// RECOMPUTE-FROM-SCRATCH, NOT PATCH-IN-PLACE. A `/who` row typed now re-labels the past hour
// and a user correction re-labels an arbitrary span, so intervals are rebuilt from the retained
// observations whenever anything changes. Interval ids are therefore snapshot-scoped, which is
// exactly why the delta carries `removed` and why persisted corrections key on TIMESTAMPS
// (§ 5.4 / § 7).
