// MEND GETS ITS HEALING LANE (JOS-86) — the golden windows and the parser arms.
//
// User report, v0.10.0: a monk's Mend never appears in the healing logs. Same SHAPE as JOS-77
// (Cleave) and JOS-81 (Smite) — an ability whose lines are not routed into a lane of its own —
// but the opposite CAUSE. Cleave and Smite were always COUNTED and merely lacked a row; Mend was
// never parsed at all, because its line is the one heal family that carries no number:
//
//     [Fri Aug 07 07:26:59 2026] You mend your wounds and heal some damage.
//
// THE WHOLE-LOG PARTITION, measured 2026-08-07 over eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt. 1,178 lines
// contain "mend" case-insensitively and they account for exactly:
//     876  `You mend your wounds and heal some damage.`   ← the ONLY mechanical heal shape
//     200  `You have become better at Mend! (N)`          ← the skill-up stream
//       1  `You have gained the ability to use Mend.`
//       2  a mob literally named `a Nisch Mas Mender`
//      99  third-party chat ABOUT the skill (all quoted, all dropped by the fixture scrub)
// So: FIRST PERSON ONLY — no `<X> mends …` exists anywhere — no failure shape, no "you are not
// wounded" refusal, and no amount in any of the 876. Nothing here invents an arm for a sentence
// the game has never printed (AGENTS.md awaiting-sample law); the refusal tests below pin that.
//
// THE OWNER'S OWN LOG PRINTS IT, so NOTHING IS INJECTED. The reporter's slice
// (.triage/slices/01KZE3WQDHX4S2QPQ16SMFRHF6.log, 7 Mend lines) is a user's private game log and
// never becomes a fixture — but it did not have to. The owner is a paladin/monk loadout and
// mended 876 times, so both windows below are his real committed bytes and the sentence under
// test is byte-identical to the reporter's.
//
// WHY THE LANE READS 0 AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT. Hit points really did go back on the bar; the
// game declines to say how many. Filing this as a `heal` with `amount: 0` would have been a lie
// with a long tail — the ledger would count a tick that "landed on a full health bar"
// (fullOverheal), the row's `min` would collapse to 0, and foldHealAnalytics would enter a
// 0-damage "Mend proc" into the proc model. So it is its own event kind (`healUnstated`) with NO
// amount field, and its own lane classification ('unstated') whose 0 means "no measurement
// exists", never "the measurement was zero". It enters no sum anywhere. The word tests for that
// distinction live in tests/healRows.test.mts (rule 6).
//
// LAW 8 GATE, run before and after over EVERY committed fixture: the healing view diffed
// line-for-line and every single difference was an ADDITION. Not one existing figure moved — no
// total, no count, no min/max, no overheal, no pct, no hps, no enemy row, and no damage total.
// A 0-total lane cannot move `rankLanes`' denominator (`Math.max(1, …totals)`), which is why the
// existing lanes' bar fills are identical too.
//
// ── THE HAND-READ WINDOWS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// W55  w39-spellblade-switch.log (Fri Jul 31 16:06:54 → 16:12:36) — the Mend lane sitting
//      BESIDE valued lanes on the same row. Every heal line in the span, verbatim:
//        SELF row (healer = You, target Primitive):
//          Lifetap Strike    31·31·82·31·82·31·31·31·31·31·31·31 = 474 over 12 (max 82, min 31)
//          Superior Healing  855 · 842 · 835                     = 2532 over 3 (max 855, min 835)
//          Unspecified       138                                 = 138 over 1  (the log named no
//                                                                   spell on that line)
//          ⇒ restored 3144 over 16 VALUED lines, 0 crits, max 855, min 31, overheal 0
//          Mend (unstated)   16:09:43 · 16:11:21                 = COUNT 2, and nothing else
//        PET row `an abhorrent` (the owner's charmed pet, self-healing):
//          Lifetap Strike 29 × 6 = 174   [16:09:11 :24 :40 :58 :59, 16:10:22]
//        ENEMY counter-healing:
//          an ashenbone drake  314 Drain Spirit  [16:06:54]
//          Cleric of Innoruuk → Avatar of Abhorrence 182 Valor [16:08:46]   ⇒ 496
//        NOT COUNTED, and unchanged by this work: the two `You healed an abhorrent for 138 hit
//          points.` lines at 16:07:41 / 16:07:49. `an abhorrent` is not yet in petNames and is
//          not an ENGAGED instance of the open encounter, so they fall to addHostileHeal and are
//          dropped — the same pre-existing rule the W28 bystander window pins. Stated here because a
//          golden window that quietly omits two heal lines is how a real regression hides.
//        ⇒ view total 3144 + 174 = 3318, all restored, 0 absorbed, 0 overheal, enemy 496
//
// W56  w47-special-dragon-punch.log (the Mend at Wed Jul 29 14:56:45) — a Mend with NO valued
//      heal and NO rune anywhere in the span. The self row does not exist in the friendly ledger
//      at all, so it is SYNTHESIZED for the lane to hang on, exactly as the rune lane has always
//      been synthesized (the W28 case). This is the window the report was actually about: before
//      JOS-86 this fixture's healing meter was completely empty despite a Mend in it.
