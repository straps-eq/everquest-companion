// CURATED ALERT GROUPS — every group's trigger fires on the REAL log line it claims.
//
// The catalog (src/shared/alertGroups.ts) quotes an exact line shape and an occurrence count
// beside every trigger. This suite is the enforcement: each quoted line is pushed through the
// REAL parser and the REAL AlertsModule, and the group's alert must fire. A regex someone
// "improved" without re-reading the log, or an event kind whose `where` no longer matches the
// parser's field names, fails here instead of going silently mute in the user's ears.
//
// The line texts below are verbatim from eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt (read-only sweep,
// 2026-08-03), with mob/spell names left as they appeared. They are authored inline rather
// than extracted into tests/fixtures/ because each is a single client notice with no
// surrounding state — there is no window to warm.
//
// It also pins the NEGATIVE half: the two groups the owner asked for that the log cannot
// support (feign-death failure, pet death) must stay unverified and unoffered, and the rank
// suggestion templates must fire on the rank-suffixed lines they were built from.
//
// ONE GROUP QUOTES NO LINE, and it is the exception the refusal register predicted. "Wrong
// stance for this mob" fires on the DERIVED `stanceMismatch` event the combat engine
// synthesizes — the thing alertGroupsRefused.ts's "Pet died" entry said would be needed before
// an entity-bound alert could ship. Its spec carries `derived: true` and `observed: 0`, and G1
// proves it by feeding the app's own synthesized event through the real module instead of a
// parsed line. Everything else in the catalog still quotes a counted sentence; G8 pins that the
// exemption stays exactly one flag wide.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
