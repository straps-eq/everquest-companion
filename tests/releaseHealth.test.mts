// ============================================================================
//
// Three tables of counter rows plus the feedback table's per-build bug counts become an error
// rate per build, over time, read against adoption, release dates and reporting coverage.
//
// ITS PARTNER IS `tests/healthCounters.test.mts`, which covers the client that produces those
// counts, and the two halves are one argument: that suite's "report even a clean session" drain
// exists SOLELY to make this suite's "not reporting" state possible. They are two files only
// because both together are past the repo's 400-code-line ceiling — a split, not a widened
// threshold.
//
// Everything under test is pure — `src/main/triage/releaseHealth.ts`, `usageRows.ts` and the
// panel's `releaseChart.ts` — so a whole fleet is authored by hand here and the arithmetic
// asserted exactly. No AWS, no Electron, no fixtures, no clock: this suite never skips.
//
// THE ONE CLAIM IT EXISTS TO DEFEND, restated because everything below is a way of failing it:
//
//     A BUILD THAT NEVER REPORTED MUST NEVER BE READABLE AS A CLEAN ONE.
//
// Health reporting arrives in a build; every build before it sends nothing. To a SUM, "sent
// nothing" and "sent reports and found no errors" are the same absent row — so the naive version
// of this feature would render the entire back catalogue as flawless, which is the exact inverse
// of what is known about it. The fold, the builder and the chart each keep those two apart by a
// different mechanism, and each mechanism is pinned below.
