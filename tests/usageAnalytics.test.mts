// The READ half of usage analytics: three tables of rows -> the six sections the Analytics tab
// and `triage-feedback analytics digest` render (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md A3).
//
// Everything under test is pure — `src/main/triage/usageRows.ts`, `src/main/triage/analytics.ts`,
// the panel's `analyticsRows.ts` and `scripts/analyticsDigest.mts` — so a whole population can
// be authored by hand here and the arithmetic asserted exactly. No AWS, no Electron, no
// fixtures, no clock: this suite never skips and never flakes.
//
// FOUR CLAIMS IT DEFENDS, and each one is a place the panel could quietly lie:
//
//   1. WHAT THE TABLES CANNOT ANSWER IS NOT ANSWERED. WAU/MAU and retention come from
//      `analytics_install` (never from summing daily counters — an install active on two days
//      would be counted twice), the median is a BUCKET RANGE, and a cohort younger than its
//      horizon reports null rather than a zero that reads as total churn.
//   2. EMPTY IS ZEROS, NOT A CRASH AND NOT A GAP. Every section survives empty input, and a day
//      inside the window with no rows is a zero in the series so the sparkline's x-axis is time.
//   3. A FUNNEL'S ORDER IS THE SCHEMA'S. Steps come from TELEMETRY_FUNNEL_STEPS in declared
//      order and a step with no rows is a ZERO IN THE CURVE — that is the shape of the exact
//      bug the plan was written around ("download started: never").
//   4. THE DASH IS LOAD-BEARING. An unknown rate renders as `—`; only a measured zero is `0%`.
