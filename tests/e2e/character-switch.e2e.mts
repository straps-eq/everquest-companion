/**
 * character-switch.e2e.mts — SWITCHING CHARACTERS MUST NOT REPLAY THE FANFARE (JOS-60).
 *
 * THE REPORT (owner, 2026-08-06, during the release hand-test): switching back and forth between
 * characters makes alerts fire over and over, along with the announcements overlay top-middle of
 * the screen. Every switch re-celebrates history, which makes the app unusable for anyone who
 * plays more than one character.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM, MEASURED (probe run 2026-08-06, and it is not the one the ticket guessed at).
 * A switch calls `tailCharacter`, which resets every module and re-folds the WHOLE target log with
 * `live:false`. The modules fold "silently" only in the sense that the registry schedules no flush
 * for a replay event — they still ACCUMULATE their pending deltas while folding (nothing in any
 * `onEvent` looks at `live`). Two things then push that accumulation to the renderer BEFORE
 * `log:character` says the world was rebuilt:
 *
 *   1. THE 1-SECOND HEARTBEAT, which is the one that hurts. `startHeartbeat`'s interval belongs to
 *      the PREVIOUS character and keeps ticking straight through the new character's replay; every
 *      tick calls `registry.tick` → `doFlush`. On the owner's log a replay is seconds long, so
 *      several ticks land inside it — each one shipping a slab of another character's history as
 *      an INCREMENT against the state the renderer is still holding.
 *   2. `registry.flushNow()` at the end of `tailCharacter`, one statement before the `log:character`
 *      send. Racy rather than reliably harmful (React's passive effects are scheduled behind the
 *      next IPC message, so the baseline is usually cleared first) — but it is the same mistake.
 *
 * Every always-mounted detector reads a delta as an increment: the kills module's KillMap looks
 * like a burst of fresh boss kills, the turn-ins module's like quest completions, the leveling
 * module's like dings. Confetti, the top-centre toast strip and the seeded `bossDefeat` /
 * `questComplete` alert sounds all fire off exactly those transitions.
 *
 * WHY THIS SPEC PADS A LOG. The bug's trigger is a WALL-CLOCK one — the app's own heartbeat has to
 * land inside the replay — and a 7-line fixture folds in 6 ms, so nothing lands inside it and the
 * defect is invisible. The padding is BALLAST, not a claim about the world: `PAD_LINES` copies of
 * the same real swing line `tests/e2e/gameplay.mts` already writes, at advancing timestamps, added
 * to a log while the app is tailing the OTHER character (so they are never live events). It buys
 * the one thing the reproduction needs: a replay long enough to outlive the heartbeat. The spec
 * SAYS how long the switch took, and fails if the window it needs never opened.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS.
 *   • a LIVE credited boss kill fires exactly one alert and shows exactly one card (the control:
 *     the celebration path works, so a zero later means suppressed, not broken);
 *   • switching away and BACK — twice, across a multi-second replay — fires nothing, shows nothing;
 *   • and a live kill AFTER all that switching still fires exactly once.
 *
 * THE COUNTERS ARE CUMULATIVE, because a card is transient. Alert fires are read from the alerts
 * module's own recent-fires history (the single source of truth, which deliberately survives a
 * character switch); toast cards are counted by a MutationObserver installed in the toast overlay
 * window, so a card that appeared and expired between two polls is still counted. Absences are
 * asserted with `settleStable` — wait for the reading to stop changing, THEN read it.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- character-switch`.
