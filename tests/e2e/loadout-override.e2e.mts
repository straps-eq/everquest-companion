/**
 * THE MANUAL LOADOUT OVERRIDE, DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL APP (JOS-87).
 *
 * The report: a user who plays SHD/ROG/DRU had the app deciding SHD/NEC, and said there was no
 * way to correct it. A correction surface was already shipping at the time — reachable only by
 * finding the right row in a history list and pressing Edit — which is why the two things this
 * spec measures are the two things a unit test structurally cannot see:
 *
 *   1. THE CONTROL IS REACHABLE. Preferences → Profiles mounts a control that states what is in
 *      effect and offers to change it, without the user first having to understand that the app
 *      models their loadout as a sequence of time intervals. `tests/comboOverride.test.mts`
 *      pins what the override MEANS; only a launched app can say whether anyone can find it.
 *   2. IT SURVIVES A RESTART. This is the ticket's acceptance criterion and it spans two
 *      processes, so it is asserted the way telemetry's restart is: ONE `userData` dir and ONE
 *      staged log, handed to two launches. The unit suite proves a fresh module rebuilds the
 *      override from the store's provider; this proves the store really wrote it, from a click.
 *
 * The round trip is closed at the end — "Back to autodetect" must actually give the loadout back
 * to detection, or the override is a trap rather than a correction.
 *
 * WHY THE PICK IS SHD/ROG/DRU: it is the reporter's own loadout, and this fixture's evidence
 * cannot produce it — so every assertion below fails if the write silently did nothing and the
 * panel is merely showing what it always showed.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- loadout-override`
