/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the TYPED-/loc MARKER (JOS-98).
 *
 * THE ASK, in the reporter's words: "Would also be nice if there was a marker on the map for my
 * current positon. I realize I would need to feed the map a /loc but would gladly do so."
 *
 * WHY THIS HAS TO BE A REAL APP, and it is two separate reasons:
 *
 *   1. THE LIFECYCLE, exactly as maps-pin.e2e.mts found it. `App` mounts ONE feature view at a
 *      time, so leaving the Maps tab destroys the hook that holds the marker and returning rebuilds
 *      it from localStorage. "Sticks around" is a claim about that destruction and about a process
 *      boundary, and neither exists in a unit test — tests/mapLocMarker.test.mts drives every RULE
 *      here and would pass happily while the marker vanished on the way to the Loot tab.
 *   2. THE PIXEL. The transform is pinned against a landmark in the unit suite (the wiki's /loc for
 *      Transan and Isslana against Brewall's own labels for the same two NPCs, to the unit). What
 *      that cannot see is the rest of the chain — the field, the hook, `mapFromLoc`, `project`, the
 *      viewport's clamp and the absolutely-positioned div. So this spec does the landmark check
 *      AGAIN, in the app, against the map that is actually on screen: it reads a real label point
 *      out of the loaded map, computes the /loc a player STANDING THERE would read, types that
 *      sentence into the box, and requires the crosshair to land on that label's own glyph.
 *      Nothing in that loop is hard-coded to a zone, so it runs against whatever this machine has.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL IS ASSERTED AS AN ABSENCE, which means it is asserted the only honest way: type
 * something that is not a loc, wait for the prose, and then require that NO marker exists — a
 * feature that guessed would place one, and a feature that silently ignored bad input would leave
 * the user staring at a box that did nothing.
 *
 * TWO LAUNCHES, ONE userData DIR AND ONE STAGED LOG — "sticks around" has to outlive the process
 * too. Launch 2 replays the same log, so it opens the same zone, and the marker launch 1 typed is
 * still on it.
 *
 * FRESH-MACHINE HONESTY: the map PACKS are a 200 MB game install, junctioned in when this machine
 * has one. With no packs no map draws, the `/loc` field is gated on `hasMap` and correctly absent,
 * and this spec says so and skips — the same branch maps.e2e.mts and maps-pin.e2e.mts have always
 * had.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- maps-loc`.
