/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for THE SKY TAB'S STICKY FILTERS (JOS-90).
 *
 * THE BUG, in the reporter's words: tick "Hide completed" on the Plane of Sky tab to see exactly
 * what is left, click away to any other tab, come back — and every quest you have already turned
 * in is on the screen again. Hiding completed steps is not a momentary filter, it is how a user
 * says "show me what is left", and the app forgot it the moment the view unmounted.
 *
 * WHY THE ROUND TRIP HAS TO BE DRIVEN BY A REAL APP. The unit-testable half of this is one line —
 * a `useState` initialiser reading localStorage — and a test of THAT would pass while the feature
 * stayed broken, because the bug was never in the read. It was in the LIFECYCLE: `App`'s
 * `ViewContent` mounts exactly one feature view at a time, so leaving the Sky tab destroys
 * `useQuestList` and everything it was holding. Only a spec that actually leaves the tab can
 * distinguish "the state is stored" from "the state survives being thrown away", which is why
 * every assertion below is bracketed by a NAVIGATION, and why the trip out asserts the filter bar
 * is GONE first — an unmount that never happened would make the rest of this spec a tautology.
 *
 * TWO LAUNCHES, ONE userData DIR. The tab round trip and the RESTART are different promises, and
 * a spec that only proved the first would leave "preferred, if that is where other view toggles
 * live" untested. `makeUserData()` hands both launches the same dir (the telemetry/overlay-sync
 * pattern), so launch 2 reads the localStorage launch 1 wrote — through a real process exit, not
 * a simulated one.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT: which quests the tick removes from the list. That is
 * `selectQuests`'s filter, pinned without a browser in tests/questSort.test.mts, and repeating it
 * here would only make this spec depend on the committed quest data staying the shape it is.
 * The subject here is the STATE, and the state is what the box says.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock, and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir minted per launch.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- sky-filters` (or node --import tsx this file).
