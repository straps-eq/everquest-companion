// ONE HEALING BUILDER, TWO SURFACES — and every honest sentence it prints.
//
// P2 of docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md (owner ruling: "the combat panel lacks the overlay's
// HEAL functionality — parity", "panel and overlay share as much functionality as possible
// through shared components — drill-down included"). Before it, the floating heal overlays had
// all of the healing UI and the Combat tab had none — a total divergence, not a subtle one. Now
// both render from `healRows.healPanel`, exactly as both damage meters render from
// `petRows.meterPanel`, and the last block below is the pin that keeps it that way.
//
// The windows are synthetic on the same footing as tests/combatPetNesting.test.mts: these are
// pure derivations over already-aggregated data, so what is worth pinning is not a log span but
// the invariants that make the layout HONEST —
//
//   1. exactly TWO levels exist, because the model has exactly two (healer → flat lane list).
//      There is no third level to invent: a HealSpellView has no children, and HoT ticks are
//      indistinguishable from direct heals in the log (shared/combat.ts).
//   2. a stale drill renders LEVEL 1 without the stored value being touched — the same rule the
//      damage meter and the overlay drill already keep.
//   3. absorption is never dressed up as restored healing: no overheal is invented for a rune,
//      and the GRANTED-not-consumed caveat travels with every absorption number.
//   4. the count-only absorption families (absorbed swings, damage shields) carry no amount, so
//      they are never a bar and never in a total.
//   5. counter-healing (enemies healed) is an ANNOTATION and never enters the healer ranking.
//   6. an UNSTATED lane (JOS-86 — Mend, whose line carries no number) never prints a figure it
//      does not have. Its `total` is 0 because no amount exists, so every string that would
//      render that 0 as a measurement — a range, an average, "0 effective" — is replaced by the
//      reason there is no number. This is rule 3's twin: rule 3 stops a number meaning more than
//      it does, rule 6 stops an ABSENCE being read as a number.
