EQ Legends Companion can send anonymous usage counts so the person building it can see
which parts are used and which parts break. It is **on by default**, you are asked about
it the first time you run the app, and you can turn it off at any time in
**Preferences → Usage analytics** — where you can also read the exact events waiting to be
sent, as JSON.

**This build does send.** The counts on this page go to one address, run by the person who
builds this app, in an account used for nothing else — the address is compiled in, and
nothing in your settings, in the app, or on disk can point it somewhere else. Nothing is
sent before the notice on your first run has appeared, and turning this off deletes
everything waiting to be sent **and** your anonymous id, straight away. Preferences shows
you the last batch that actually left, in full.

## What can never be collected

Not "what we choose not to collect" — what the schema has no room for. Every field below
is either a number or one value from a fixed list printed on this page. There is no
free-text field anywhere in it, so there is nowhere for any of this to go:

- your character names, your server, your guild, anyone you play with
- zone, mob, spell, item or quest names
- anything you typed: chat, tells, search boxes, alert names, feedback text
- any line of your log, or any file path
- your IP address, your machine name, your account — there is no account

## What identifies a send

One random id (`analyticsId`), generated on your machine, stored in your settings file, and
deliberately **different from** the id a feedback report uses — the two cannot be joined.
You can replace it at any time from Preferences; doing so also throws away everything
waiting to be sent, and the new id looks like a brand-new install.

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `analyticsId` | a random UUID, replaceable from Preferences |
| `appVersion` | the app version, e.g. `0.2.0` |
| `channel` | `prod` · `dev` |
| `platform` | `win32` · `darwin` · `linux` · `other` |
| `tzOffsetBucket` | your UTC offset in whole hours (-12 to 14) |

Events are held on your machine (at most 500 of them, oldest dropped first) and would
be sent in batches, not one by one. Schema version: 1.

## Events

### `sessionStart`

Once, when the app finishes starting up.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `coldStartMsBucket` | bucket index | How long the app took to become usable. |

### `sessionHeartbeat`

Every 5 minutes while the app is open — the "is anyone using it right now" signal. Present on the first of these that follows startup, once per launch: how long reading your log history took, and how smoothly. Reading a log after switching character is deliberately not measured.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uptimeMs` | whole number | How long this session has been running. |
| `linesParsed` | whole number (optional) | How many log lines were read since the last one of these. A count of lines only — no line, and no part of one, is ever sent. Starting the app re-reads your log history, so those lines are counted again each launch. |
| `startup.replayMs` | whole number (optional) | How long the app took to read your log history when it started. |
| `startup.eventsReplayed` | whole number | How many log lines that was. A count only — no line, and no part of one, is sent. |
| `startup.dutyPct` | whole number | What share of that time was spent working rather than deliberately pausing, 0–100. |
| `startup.maxBlockMs` | whole number | The longest single moment the app was unresponsive while reading. |
| `startup.blocksOver50` | whole number | How many of those moments were longer than 50 ms. |
| `startup.logSizeBucket` | bucket index | How big the log it read is — a RANGE (see below), never the size itself. |

### `sessionEnd`

Once, when the app closes. Present on the first of these that follows startup, once per launch: how long reading your log history took, and how smoothly. Reading a log after switching character is deliberately not measured.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `durationMs` | whole number | How long the session lasted. |
| `viewsVisited` | whole number | How many different tabs were opened. |
| `linesParsed` | whole number (optional) | How many log lines were read since the last one of these. A count of lines only — no line, and no part of one, is ever sent. Starting the app re-reads your log history, so those lines are counted again each launch. |
| `startup.replayMs` | whole number (optional) | How long the app took to read your log history when it started. |
| `startup.eventsReplayed` | whole number | How many log lines that was. A count only — no line, and no part of one, is sent. |
| `startup.dutyPct` | whole number | What share of that time was spent working rather than deliberately pausing, 0–100. |
| `startup.maxBlockMs` | whole number | The longest single moment the app was unresponsive while reading. |
| `startup.blocksOver50` | whole number | How many of those moments were longer than 50 ms. |
| `startup.logSizeBucket` | bucket index | How big the log it read is — a RANGE (see below), never the size itself. |

### `viewDwell`

| `ms` | whole number | How long it was on screen. |

### `overlayToggle`

When you open or close a floating meter.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `fight` · `overall` · `heal-fight` · `heal-overall` · `events` · `toast` | Which overlay. |
| `open` | true / false | Opened or closed. |

### `featureUse`

When you use one of the listed features.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feature` | `mapOpen` · `mapSearch` · `rangeSelect` · `comboCorrection` · `feedbackOpen` · `alertGroupAdd` · `drillPet` · `copyView` · `speechPreview` · `procAnalyticsOpen` · `questFavorite` · `lootFilter` · `profileSwitch` | Which one. A fixed list. |
| `count` | whole number | How many times, since the last batch. |

### `alertFired`

A rollup of how many alerts fired — never which alert, and never its text.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `count` | whole number | Alerts fired. |

| `soundPackCount` | whole number | How many sound packs are installed. |
| `updateChannel` | `main` · `stable` | Update channel. |

### `funnelStep`

When you reach a step of one of the three flows listed below.

| Field | Values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `funnel` | `first-run` · `voice-install` · `feedback` | Which flow. |
| `step` | a step of that flow (below) | Which step it reached. |
| `outcome` | `ok` · `failed` · `queued` (optional) | How it ended. |
| `failureClass` | `network` · `checksum` · `disk` · `timeout` · `other` (optional) | A coarse category when it failed. Never an error message. |

### `healthCounters`

With each session report (every few minutes, and at close): counts of things that went wrong since the last one. Sent even when they are all zero. Counts only, never messages.

| Field | Values | What it means |

| `failureClass` | `network` · `checksum` · `disk` · `timeout` · `other` (optional) | A coarse category when it failed. |

## Flows

A `funnelStep` event says which step of one of these you reached — nothing else.

**`first-run`** — `installed` → `logDetected` → `firstParse` → `firstNonOverviewView` → `firstOverlayEnabled`

**`voice-install`** — `engineSelected` → `downloadStarted` → `downloadCompleted` → `firstUtterance`

**`feedback`** — `dialogOpened` → `sendPressed` → `sendFinished`

## Buckets

Where a raw number would say too much about one person, the app sends a RANGE instead.
These are the exact ranges, taken from the schema:

**`coldStartMsBucket`** — How long the app took to start.

| Bucket | Range |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | < 1 s |
| 1 | 1 s – 2.5 s |
| 2 | 2.5 s – 5 s |
| 3 | 5 s – 10 s |
| 4 | 10 s – 20 s |
| 5 | ≥ 20 s |

**`charCountBucket`** — How many character logs the app can see.

| Bucket | Range |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 – 4 |
| 4 | 5 – 8 |
| 5 | ≥ 9 |

**`logSizeBucket`** — Size of the log file being read.

| Bucket | Range |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | < 1 MB |
| 1 | 1 MB – 10 MB |
| 2 | 10 MB – 100 MB |
| 3 | 100 MB – 512 MB |
| 4 | 512 MB – 2 GB |
| 5 | ≥ 2 GB |

**`alertCountBucket`** — How many alerts are configured.

| Bucket | Range |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 – 4 |
| 2 | 5 – 9 |
| 3 | 10 – 24 |
| 4 | 25 – 49 |
| 5 | ≥ 50 |

## Turning it off

**Preferences → Usage analytics** has one switch. Turning it off stops collection, throws
away everything currently held on your machine, and discards the random id — all
immediately. Nothing is kept to be sent later. Turning it back on starts from empty, with a
new id, which counts as a brand-new install.
